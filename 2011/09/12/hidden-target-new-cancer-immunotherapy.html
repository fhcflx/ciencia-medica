Antibody-based therapies are targeted at specific molecular elements of cells (often receptor proteins) and thus have improved safety over standard chemotherapy regimens, which has resulted in extended survival and improved quality of life for cancer patients with conventional treatment refractoriness. Because antibodies are too large to cross intact cell membrane and access intracellular locations, antibody therapy has traditionally targeted extracellular or secreted proteins expressed by cancer cells.
