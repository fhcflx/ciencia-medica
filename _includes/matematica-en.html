<strong>Mathematics in science:</strong> Mathematics is the formal language of science, enabling precise description and prediction of natural phenomena. While the use of mathematics in describing nature dates back at least to ancient Mesopotamia, the modern Western scientific tradition began with the rediscovery of classical and Hellenistic Greco-Roman texts and Islamic authors. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, translations of Islamic experimentalists such as Ibn al-Haytham (Arab, author of the <em>Book of Optics</em>, 1021; advocate of skepticism, empiricism, the inductive method, and a precursor of Occam's Razor), Al-Biruni (Persian, same era; advocate for addressing observational bias and systematic error through quantitative analysis), and Ibn Sina (Avicenna, Persian philosopher and physician who described inductive methods analogous to those of British empiricist John Stuart Mill) circulated in Europe. Western precursors of the scientific method, such as Robert Grosseteste (England, 1175) and Francis Bacon (England, 1561), were influenced by these texts. The 15th and 16th centuries saw key catalysts such as Gutenberg's press (Germany, 1400), Copernicus's revolution (Poland, 1473), Tycho Brahe's astronomy (Denmark, 1546) and his assistant Johannes Kepler (Germany, 1571), and an emerging socio-political-economic environment based on colonialism, leading to what the 20th century called the "scientific revolution." At that time, new translations revived the empiricism of Galen of Pergamon (physician, Asia Minor, 2nd century) and the skepticism of Sextus Empiricus (philosopher, Roman Empire, 2nd century), which became widely influential in Europe. The major precursor of the modern observational method and rigorous mathematical description of science was Galileo Galilei (Pisa, 1564). In 1623, he published <em>Il Saggiatore</em> (<em>The Assayer</em>), a letter to Pope Urban VIII, in which he wrote his famous phrase, "Philosophy is written in this grand book (...), the universe, (...) in the language of mathematics." At that time, there was no distinction between science and philosophy as there is today. Notably, Galileo denounced the lies, defamation, and persecution his ideas provoked, culminating in his house arrest in 1633. He was not imprisoned or executed, partly due to his friendship with the pope. However, his most famous work, <em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</em>, was too much for the church, as it defended heliocentrism and ridiculed the Aristotelian geocentric system. <em>The Assayer</em>, considered his main "manifesto," sets out his ideas on the scientific method. The apex of the idea that mathematics reflects nature's behavior and should be science's primary language was Isaac Newton's <em>Principia</em> (England, 1643), which influenced Western thought for centuries.<br>
