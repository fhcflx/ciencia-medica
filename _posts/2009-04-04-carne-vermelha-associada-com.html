Mais uma novidade tanto para os "naturebas" quanto para os céticos. Um grande estudo publicado numa das mais
lidas revistas médicas do planeta concluiu pela reafirmação de que o consumo de grande quantidade de
carne vermelha e carne processada (presunto, mortadela, patês, etc) correlaciona-se com aumento de mortalidade
por câncer e doenças do coração em pessoas de ambos os sexos. Para os adeptos do "não deixo meu sanduba de mortadela"
a notícia não é de todo ruim: a recomendação é de que o consumo destes produtos seja moderado. Uma dieta de todo
vegetariana não está em questão neste estudo, mas as pessoas que consumiram quantidades moderadas de carne vermelha
e processada não pareceram ter um risco especialmente elevado. É óbvio que ninguém definiu o que é "moderado",
mas algumas recomendações são especificadas pelo American Institute for Cancer Research. O coordenador do estudo frisa
que não é vegetariano!! Leia mais:

March 26, 2009 — Eating red and processed meat is associated with modest increases in total mortality, cancer mortality, and
cardiovascular disease mortality rates, according to the results of a large, prospective study reported in the March 23
issue of the <em>Archives of Internal Medicine</em>.
<p>
  "High intakes of red or processed meat may increase the risk of mortality," write Rashmi Sinha, PhD, from the National Cancer
  Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services in Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues.
  "Our objective was to determine the relations of red, white, and processed meat intakes to risk for total and cause-specific
  mortality."
</p>
<p>
  The National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study enrolled approximately half a million people aged 50 to 71 years
  at baseline. A food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline allowed estimation of meat intake, and Cox proportional
  hazards regression models allowed calculation of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles of
  meat intake.
</p>
<p>
  Red meat included all types of beef and pork such as bacon, beef, cold cuts, hamburgers, hotdogs, steak, and meats in pizza,
  lasagna, and stew. White meat included chicken, turkey, and fish along with poultry cold cuts, canned tuna, and low-fat
  hotdogs. Processed meats could include either red or white meats in the form of sandwich meats or cold cuts as well as
  bacon, red meat and poultry sausages, and regular hotdogs and low-fat hotdogs made from poultry. The authors note that
  some of the meats may overlap in the 3 categories, but they were not duplicated or used in the same models in the study
  analysis.
</p>
<p>
  The models considered covariates of age, education, marital status, presence or absence of family history of cancer
  (for cancer mortality only), race, body mass index, smoking history, physical activity, energy intake, alcohol drinking,
  use of vitamin supplements, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, and use of menopausal hormone therapy in women.
  Primary endpoints of the study were total mortality and deaths caused by cancer, cardiovascular disease, injury and
  sudden deaths, and all other causes.
</p>
<p>
  During 10 years of follow-up, 47,976 men and 23,276 women died. Overall mortality risks were increased for men and women
  in the highest vs the lowest quintile of red meat intake (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.27 - 1.35; and HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.30-1.43,
  respectively) and processed meat intake (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12 - 1.20; and HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.20 - 1.31, respectively).
  Men and women with higher intake also had increased risks for cancer mortality for red meat (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.16 - 1.29;
  and HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.12 - 1.30, respectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06 - 1.19; and HR, 1.11; 95% CI 1.04
  - 1.19, respectively).
</p>
<p>
  Cardiovascular disease risk was increased for men and women in the highest quintile of intake of red meat (HR, 1.27; 95% CI,
  1.20 - 1.35; and HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.37 - 1.65, respectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03 - 1.15; and HR, 1.38;
  95% CI, 1.26 - 1.51, respectively). For the highest vs the lowest quintile of white meat intake for both men and women,
  there was an inverse association for total mortality, cancer mortality, and mortality from all other causes.
</p>
<p>
  "Red and processed meat intakes were associated with modest increases in total mortality, cancer mortality, and
  cardiovascular disease mortality," the study authors write. "In contrast, high white meat intake and a low-risk meat diet
  was associated with a small decrease in total and cancer mortality."
</p>
<p>
  Limitations of this study include possible residual confounding by smoking; possible measurement error; and cohort
  predominantly non-Hispanic white, more educated, with less smoking, less fat and red meat intake, and more intake of fiber
  and fruit and vegetables than similarly aged adults in the US population, limiting generalizability.
</p>
<p>
  "These results complement the recommendations by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research
  Fund to reduce red and processed meat intake to decrease cancer incidence," the study authors write. "Future research should
  investigate the relation between subtypes of meat and specific causes of mortality."
