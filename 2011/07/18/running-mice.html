Researchers of the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues genetically engineered mice to lack the IL-15Rα gene, and the modified mice ran six times farther than normal mice each night.

The genetically-modified mice seemed to lack fast-twitch muscles - muscles that allow more precise movements but tire faster - and to have only slow-twitch muscles - which have more endurance but do not allow fine movements.
