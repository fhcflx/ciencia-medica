The 2011 edition of the Annual Meeting of the Brazilian Federation of Experimental Biology Societies (<a href="http://www.fesbe.org.br/v5/">FeSBE</a>, Federação de Sociedades de Biologia Experimental) took place from August 24th through 27th, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Scientists from all over the world attended this meeting. We sent two brief communications in poster form.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Poster 1: </span><span class="quatro" style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;"><b>EVALUATION OF THE ANALGESIC EFFECT OF VENLAFAXINE, A SEROTININ AND NORADRENALINE REUPTAKE INHIBITOR.</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">The aim of this study was to test the  analgesic effects of the antidepressant venlafaxine in several  experimental models of nociception.<br /><br />Methods and Results:<br /><br />Acetic  acid-induced writhing: Groups of six to twelve mice were administered  i.p. 0.6% acetic acid (10 mL kg−1, i.p.), and the number of abdominal  contractions was registered for 20 min, starting 30 min after the  injection. Animals were pre-treated with venlafaxine (10, 20, 40 and 60  mg kg−1, i.p.), 30 min before acetic acid administration. DMSO 5% was  used as vehicle (control group). With the exception of 10 mg kg−1, all  other doses of venlafaxine (20, 40 and 60 mg kg−1, i.p) produced  significant inhibition of writhing (p&lt;0,05) (16.2±12.0, 11.6±8.0 and  3.7±2.0 respectively) when compared with control group (34.0±13.2).  Hot-plate test: groups of nine mice were treated with venlafaxine (10,  20, 40 and 60 mg kg−1, i.p.), 5% DMSO (controls) or morphine (10 mg  kg−1, i.p.) as standard. Measurements were performed before (time 0) and  after 30, 60 and 90 min from drug administration; a cut-off time of 45  seconds was used to avoid paw lesions. Only 60 mg/Kg, i.p. of  venlafaxine showed a significant effect on latency time to licking or  jumping (24.06±4.99 s) when compared with control group (6.88±1.15 s) on  time of 30 min. Morphine (10 mg kg−1, i.p. showed a significant effect  (p&lt;0.05) (39.5±4.13, 34.5±5.54, 29.4±5.08 s) when compared to control  group (6.88±1.15, 6.58±1.88, 8.77±2.27 s) on times of 30, 60 and 90 min  respectively. Rota-rod test: Groups of six mice were treated with  venlafaxine (10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed on the rota-rod  30 min after the injection. DMSO 5% was used as vehicle (control group).  The number of falls was recorded by one minute and the length of stay  in the bar. No difference between groups treated with venlafaxine and  control group was observed in any period of time. Statistical analysis:  All values were expressed as means±S.D.M. Data were analyzed using ANOVA  followed by Tukey test (p&lt;0.05 was considered significant).<br /><br /><b>Conclusions:<br /><br />These  results corroborate research that reported the inhibitory effect of  venlafaxine on the signs of spontaneous pain and hindpaw mechanical and  thermal hypersensitivity in animal models of tonic nociception and  neuropathic pain. Studies continue in an attempt to elucidate the action  mechanisms of these effects.</b></span><span class="quatro" style="font-size: small;"><b> </b></span><br /><span class="quatro" style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><i><span class="quatro">Link to this abstract: <a href="http://bit.ly/qrPHK7">http://bit.ly/qrPHK7</a></span></i></span><br /><span class="quatro" style="font-size: small;"><i>Link to this poster in google docs: <a href="http://bit.ly/nJXtR5">http://bit.ly/nJXtR5 </a></i></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br /><span class="quatro" style="font-size: small;">Poster 2: </span><span class="quatro" style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;"><b>EVALUATION OF ANTIPLATELET ACTIVITY OF MONOTERPENE PULEGONE</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Objectives: To evaluate the antiplatelet activity of Pulegone in human PRP.<br /><br />Methods and Results:<br /><br />Platelet  aggregation was measured according to the method of Born and Cross (J  Physiol. 163; 178-195, 1963). Briefly, platelet aggregation was induced  at 37ºC in the aggregometer, with stirring at 1000 rpm, by addition of  ADP (4µM) as agonist. The resulting aggregation, measured as the change  in light transmission, was recorded for 5 min and presented as percent  aggregation related to control (100%). Pulegone oil (PUL) was emulsified  with Tween 80 (660 µg mL−1, control) and concentrations of 110, 220,  440 and 660 µg mL−1 were used. PUL 220, 440 and 660 µg mL−1 reduced  significantly (p&lt;0.001) the platelet aggregation induced by ADP (4µM)  in 39.8, 47.3 and 70.1% (60.2±27.5; 52.7±17.23 and 29.9±7.60%  aggregation) respectively when compared to control group.</span><span style="font-size: small;"><b> </b>Statistical analysis: All values are expressed as mean ±  SD. Differences between the sample-treated and control groups were  submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey-Newman-Keuls  test for multiple comparisons (p&lt; 0.05) was considered significant.<span class="quatro"> </span></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /><b>Conclusions:<br /><br />Direct  stimulation of platelets by ADP results in shape change, reversible  aggregation at physiological concentrations of calcium, and finally,  desensitization. Transduction of the ADP signal involves a transient  rise in free cytoplasmic calcium, due to the mobilization of internal  stores and secondary store-mediated influx, and a concomitant inhibition  of adenylyl cyclase activity. It is possible that the antiplatelet  effect of pulegone is due to blocking of a step of ADP-induced platelet  stimulation.&nbsp;</b><b><span class="quatro"></span></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><i><span class="quatro">Link to this abstract:&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/pvZGwU">http://bit.ly/pvZGwU</a></span></i></span><br /><span class="quatro" style="font-size: small;"><b>&nbsp;</b><i>Link to this poster in google docs: <a href="http://bit.ly/nfyk3w">http://bit.ly/nfyk3w</a></i><b><br /></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br /><span class="quatro" style="font-size: small;"><b>&nbsp;Link to FESBE 2011 program: <a href="http://bit.ly/ramXDw">http://bit.ly/ramXDw</a></b></span><br /><span class="quatro" style="font-size: small;"><b>&nbsp;</b></span><span class="quatro"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span>
