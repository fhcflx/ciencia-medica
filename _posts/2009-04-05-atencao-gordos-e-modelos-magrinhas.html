Uma metanálise de vários estudos publicada recentemente mostrou que o aumento do índice de massa corpórea (IMC) correlaciona-se
com aumento de mortalidade por várias causas. O interessante é que um IMC abaixo de determinado nível também mostrou essa
correlação. O nível ótimo de IMC ficou entre 22,5 e 25kg/m2. Acima e baixo destes limites, a mortalidade aumenta. A relação
com IMC é bem clara e fácil de entender. Quem tem IMC entre 30-35 vai viver , em média, 2-4 anos a menos que as pessoas da faixa
"boa". Quem tem IMC de 40-45 vai viver, em média, 8-10 anos a menos. O excesso de mortalidade é por doenças do coração (aumenta
40%), diabetes (aumenta até 120%), câncer (10% mais), doenças respiratórias (20% mais) e outras, como doenças dos rins e fígado.
Não existe explicação ainda, todavia, para o aumento de mortalidade entre os magrelos. Como muitas meninas que desfilam nas
passarelas tem IMC entre 15 e 20 (às vezes mais baixo!) elas potencialmente estão em alto risco, assim como os obesos!!! Leiam mais:

March 17, 2009 — Body-mass index (BMI) above the ideal range may cause a large increase in mortality rates, according to the
results of a collaborative analysis of 57 prospective studies reported in the March 18 Online First issue of <em>Lancet</em>.
<p>
  "The main associations of...BMI with overall and cause-specific mortality can best be assessed by long-term prospective
  follow-up of large numbers of people," write Gary Whitlock, and colleagues from The Prospective Studies Collaboration at
  the University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. "The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these
  associations by sharing data from many studies."
</p>
<p>
  The investigators analyzed the association of baseline BMI with mortality in 57 prospective studies enrolling a total of
  894,576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America, with median recruitment year 1979. Mean age at recruitment
  was 46 ± 11 years, 61% were men, and mean BMI was 25 ± 4 kg/m². The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status,
  and study, and the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded.
</p>
<p>
  Mortality rate was lowest with BMI at approximately 22.5 to 25 kg/m² for both men and women. At higher baseline BMI, there
  were positive associations for several specific causes and inverse associations for none. Absolute excess risks for higher
  BMI and smoking were approximately additive.
</p>
<p>
  On average, each 5-kg/m² higher BMI was associated with approximately 30% higher overall mortality rate (hazard ratio per 5
  kg/m² [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 -1.32): 40% for vascular mortality (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.37 - 1.45); 60%
  to 120% for diabetic (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.89 - 2.46), renal (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1·27 - 1·99), and hepatic (HR, 1.82; 95% CI,
  1·59 - 2·09) mortality; 10% for neoplastic mortality (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06 - 1.15); and 20% for respiratory (HR, 1.20; 95%
  CI, 1.07 - 1.34) and all other mortality (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.16 - 1.25).
</p>
<p>
  BMI less than 22·5 to 25 kg/m² was inversely associated with overall mortality rate, primarily because of strong inverse
  associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer. Although cigarette consumption per smoker varied little with BMI,
  these inverse associations were much
  <br />
  stronger for smokers vs nonsmokers.

  "Although other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI,
  and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about
  22.5–25 kg/m²," the study authors write. "The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular
  <br />
  disease and is probably largely causal. At 30–35 kg/m², median survival is reduced by 2–4 years; at 40–45 kg/m², it is reduced
  by 8–10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22.5 kg/m² is due mainly
  to smoking-related diseases,
  <br />
  and is not fully explained."
</p>

  "In adult life, it may be easier to avoid substantial weight gain than to lose that weight once it has been gained," the study
  authors conclude. "By avoiding a further increase from 28 kg/m² to 32 kg/m², a typical person in early middle age would gain
  about 2 years of life expectancy. Alternatively, by avoiding an increase from 24 kg/m² to 32 kg/m² (ie, to a third above the
  apparent optimum), a young adult would on average gain about 3 extra years of life."
