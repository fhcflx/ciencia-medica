<span class="sidenote">Cell (from Latin cellula = small room): the structural and functional unit of living organisms. The English scientist Robert Hooke described what he called "cells" in his 1665 treatise Micrographia, observing plant tissues under a microscope. He thought the structures resembled honeycomb, hence the name. Today, we know that all living beings are made up of one (unicellular) or many (multicellular) cellular units (cell theory, first stated in 1839 by Schleiden and Schwann). The cell consists of a membrane surrounding a gel called cytoplasm and a structure called the nucleus where the genes are located.</span>
