**[Systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of prokinetics in gastroesophageal reflux and in gastroesophageal reflux disease in Pediatrics](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-05822009000300002).** Magalhães, PVS; Bastos, TRPD; Appolinário, JCB; Bacaltchuk, J; Mota Neto, JIS. Rev. Paul. Pediatr. 27 (3), 2009.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, by systematic review and meta-analysis, randomized studies comparing the prokinetics (domperidone, bromopride, metoclopramide and bethanechol) to placebo in the treatment of gastroesophagic reflux (GER) and gastroesophagic reflux disease (GERD) in children.

METHODS: Bibliographic search for randomized clinical trials (Medline, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts, ISI/Web of Science, CINAHL, Lilacs e Cochrane). The primary outcome was the modification of reflux symptoms. Other outcomes were: GER-related complications, alterations in control exams, life quality, adverse events and abandon of treatment.

RESULTS: The metanalysis included four studies on domperidone, two on metoclopramide, and one on bethanechol. No study of bromopride was retrieved. The risk of non-response to the treatment was significantly smaller in children that received prokinetics in comparison to placebo (RR 0.35, 95%CI 0.14-0.88). Individual therapeutic advantage regarding placebo was related to domperidone (n=126; RR 0.27; 95%CI 0.14-0.52, NNT 3; I2 0%) and bethanechol (n=44; RR 0.19; 95%CI 0.05-0.55; NNT 2), but not to metoclopramide (n=71; RR 0.63; 95%CI 0.07-5.71; I2 92.2%).

CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for prokinetic use in GER and GERD in children is limited because the few studies report preliminary trials that evaluate short-term responses and show methodological limitations.
