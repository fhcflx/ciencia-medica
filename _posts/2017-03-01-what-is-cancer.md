excerpt: "What is cancer? Learn about the biology, genetics, mutations, and risk factors of this disease that affects millions of people worldwide."
---

Siddhartha Mukherjee, physician and writer, called cancer{% include cancer-en.html %} the "emperor of all maladies" in his best-selling book. If diseases were measured by deaths, however, tuberculosis would undoubtedly be the emperor, having caused over a billion deaths throughout human history. Nowadays, with increasing control of infectious and cardiovascular diseases, cancer stands out as the leading cause of human deaths. In 2012, more than 8 million people died of cancer worldwide.

But what is cancer? It was named by ancient anatomists because the lesions burrowed into the flesh, forming "fingers" or "legs" that deeply invaded surrounding tissues, resembling a crab. To begin with, cancer is not a single disease.

There are hundreds of different types and subtypes of cancer. Until the 1990s, differentiation between them was mainly based on the site of origin and the type of cell they arose from, or, in technical terms, their _anatomopathological_ appearance. Since the end of the Human Genome Project{% include human-genome-project-en.html %} in 2003, the genetic alterations behind the various types of cancer have been mapped in increasing detail. The Cancer Genome Project has already mapped the main genetic abnormalities of the most frequent types of cancer. This opened the possibility for _molecular classification_.

When I was a student, I learned that _cancer is a cellular disease_, but this definition has been modified by new knowledge. As someone recently said, in the last 10 years, we have learned more about cancer than in the previous 1,000 years. So, we can update the definition to _cancer is a molecular disease_.

We are all made up of cells{% include cell-en.html %}, an astonishing 37 trillion of them, more or less. How do they manage to stay cohesive in an organism that remains unitary and perceives itself as an individual for decades? This is one of nature's real miracles, which we hardly notice. One of the most surprising things about living organisms is that this enormous number of cells does not remain static. They have much shorter lives than the organism they inhabit, so they need to multiply throughout our lives.

Our blood cells are renewed every 120 days, on average. Our skin is renewed every 30-40 days in adults (ranging from 2 weeks in babies to two months in the elderly). The intestinal epithelium is even faster, renewing every 4-5 days on average! Even bones go through this process: in the first year of life, we "replace" our entire skeleton, and in adults, bone renewal is about 10% per year. Neurons are one of the very few cell types that do not renew in mammals. In fact, during growth, we _lose_ a certain number of neurons in some brain areas (there are still doubts whether some are renewed or not).

This means that, although we maintain our physical and psychological individuality, in practice, every ten years or so, we "change bodies" (except for neurons). This renewal rate is higher in childhood and decreases in the elderly. Our cells, then, are in a constant state of division and multiplication, even in adults. It is estimated that, in a human lifetime, about 10 quadrillion cell divisions occur—more than 40 times the number of stars in the Milky Way! This is impressive and explains the main source of genetic mutations in our cells: the cell division mechanism itself.

When a cell divides, it must copy all its genetic material{% include genetic-material-en.html %}. That's no small feat. The human genome{% include genome-en.html %} consists of 22,000 genes{% include gene-en.html %} spread across 3.3 billion base pairs of DNA{% include dna-en.html %} (the DNA molecule is divided into basic "bricks" called bases, which are copied one by one during cell division). The process of copying the cell's genetic material is one of the most tightly controlled biological phenomena. After all, ensuring as few mutations as possible is critical for our survival. Even so, with all the protective mechanisms in cells, it is estimated that 0.1 to 1 mutation{% include mutation-en.html %} occurs in each genome replication. This amounts to at least 1 quadrillion genetic mutations in a human organism over a lifetime! The vast majority of these mutations, however, will not cause cancer.

Most mutations will have absolutely no effect, as the genetic code is highly redundant. Moreover, most of the base pairs in human DNA do not code for any gene. So, only a small fraction of mutations will impact cell physiology. Even then, not all of these impacts will alter cell growth. Only mutations that change how cells control cell growth (the cell cycle) can cause cancer. It is estimated that about 1,000 genes control the cell cycle, so only a small fraction of genetic mutations that _actually_ affect cells will have the potential to alter the cell cycle and cause cancer.

It is very difficult to estimate the number of genetic mutations with the potential to cause cancer that occur during a human lifetime, but that number is certainly large by any perspective, probably in the order of many millions. This leads us to the current scientific theory about the origin of cancer: it is a byproduct of normal cell division in living organisms. This means there is no real cause of cancer; it occurs randomly, by chance. It's like playing the lottery all your life—the chances of winning are small, but eventually, some "win" the cancer lottery. This also makes us wonder why cancer is not _much more common_! Today, the main hypothesis is that the immune system spends its life "hunting" and destroying cells with the potential to cause cancer (transformed cells) in our bodies. This explains why, recently, modern treatments that use the body's own immune system (immunotherapy) have been so successful.

So, to summarize, cancer is not a single disease; it is a large group of very different diseases, caused by genetic mutations that occur naturally throughout everyone's life. Some questions arise. Why does exposure to environmental factors increase the chance of getting cancer? The answer relates to the theory of cancer. UV radiation from the sun, chemicals, X-rays, and other forms of radiation increase the chance of cells having genetic mutations by damaging DNA. A diet rich in carbohydrates makes the body produce a lot of insulin, and insulin stimulates cancer cells and increases their survival against the immune system.

This leads to a final conclusion: it is possible to _greatly_ reduce the incidence of cancer by reducing exposure to environmental factors such as sun, smoking, alcohol, and carbohydrates, but _it is impossible to reduce the incidence of cancer to zero_. So, will cancer always exist? "Always" is a strong word, but it is reasonable to think that, in any foreseeable future, cancer will continue to exist. However, it is indeed possible to greatly reduce its incidence with simple and inexpensive measures, but that is a subject for another post.
