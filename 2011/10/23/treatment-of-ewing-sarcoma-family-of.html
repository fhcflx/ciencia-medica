Recently published in Pediatric Blood and Cancer:<br /><br />Ewing sarcoma treatment is highly succesfull in non-metastatic patients, but the high-dose chemotherapy poses a significant risk of secondary leukemia. A group from Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain has published a small phase II single-arm non-randomized study reporting good results with a less toxic, modified chemotherapy protocol. Their results were as good as standard chemotherapy that uses higher cummulative doses, and they had no secondary disease in their group, after a median follow-up of more than 4 years! Relapses were seen in patients that did not receive radiotherapy, and they were late (more than 2 years after end of treatment). This report may represent a major advance in the treatment of non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma and should yield larger studies to test the feasibility of this lower-exposure chemotherapy approach.<br /><br />Read the article: <a href="http://bit.ly/o42Eha">http://bit.ly/o42Eha</a><br /><br /><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pbc.22813/abstract#.TqQpAepzCcs.blogger">Treatment of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors with a modified P6 protocol in children and adolescents - Mora - 2011 - Pediatric Blood &amp; Cancer - Wiley Online Library</a>
