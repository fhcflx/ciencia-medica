<span class="sidenote">Glioma is a tumor of glial cells, which are cells that protect, nourish, and support neurons. Gliomas can occur in the brain, spinal cord, or even along peripheral nerves. They account for about 30% of all central nervous system tumors and 80% of primary malignant brain tumors. Gliomas can be classified as low-grade (generally benign) or high-grade (malignant). In children and adolescents, unlike adults, malignant gliomas are less common.</span>
