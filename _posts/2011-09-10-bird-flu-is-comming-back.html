<p id="p-4">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  issued a bulletin last week that stirred a lot of press attention. It warned of “a major resurgence                      of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza amid  signs that a mutant strain of the deadly bird flu virus is spreading in                      Asia and beyond, with unpredictable risks to human  health.” Other international health organizations, however, hurried to play  down                      the significance of this alert. FAO Chief Veterinary Officer Juan Lubroth defended the warning, implying they meant not to cause a frenzy.<br /></p><p id="p-6">Science has published a news analysis upon the topic. They reported that FAO posted the statement, titled “Bird Flu  rears its head again,” on its Web site on 29 August. The post reveals  that H5N1                      outbreaks among poultry and wild birds have been  increasing since 2008 and that the virus has re-emerged                      in many countries. Furthermore, a  variant of the virus, dubbed clade 2.3.2.1, circulating in China and  Vietnam                      has mutated in a way that renders current poultry  vaccines less effective. And since H5N1  appeared in 2003, it has killed or led to the  culling of more than 400 million domestic poultry, causing an estimated  $20                      billion in losses, and killed 331 people, roughly  60% of those it infected. The agency predicted that  a flareup of H5N1 is likely this fall and winter.                    </p>Read the original post:<br /><a href="https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/87196/icode/">https://bit.ly/o7IaF1</a><br />Read the Science analysis:<br /><a href="https://bit.ly/pwxs9s">https://bit.ly/pwxs9s</a>
