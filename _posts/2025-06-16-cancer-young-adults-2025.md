In recent years, a series of studies has drawn the attention of the scientific community and the public to the rising incidence of early-onset cancer—defined as cancer diagnosed before the age of 50. A 2022 article in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology ([DOI: 10.1038/s41571-022-00672-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-022-00672-8)) highlighted this phenomenon globally, showing that cancer, traditionally seen as a disease of older people, is becoming increasingly common in younger age groups.

The age classification of cancer has evolved over the decades. Traditionally, cancer was seen as a disease of the elderly, with incidence rising progressively with age. In children (0-14 years), cancer is rare, accounting for about 1% of all cases, with an annual incidence of approximately 15 cases per 100,000. In adolescents and young adults (AYA, 15-39 years), incidence is higher than in children but still low compared to older adults, ranging from 40 to 70 cases per 100,000 per year. In adults aged 40-49, incidence increases further, reaching about 150-200 cases per 100,000. After age 50, there is an exponential rise, with rates above 1,000 cases per 100,000 in older age groups.

Historically, most tumors in young people were expected to be related to rare genetic syndromes or unusual environmental exposures. However, recent studies have shown a consistent increase in cancer among people under 50, especially gastrointestinal and breast tumors, challenging previous paradigms and raising concerns about early-life environmental, behavioral, and metabolic factors.

## What is early-onset cancer?

Early-onset cancer refers to tumors diagnosed in people under 50 years old. Within this group, there are important subcategories: adolescents (15-18/24 years), young adults (25-39 years), and early middle-aged adults (40-49 years). The internationally used term for adolescents and young adults is AYA (adolescents and young adults), generally covering ages 15 to 39. The impact of a cancer diagnosis at this stage of life is profound, affecting not only health but also social, emotional, and economic aspects.

The classification of early-onset cancer was introduced in recent decades after the observation that certain types of cancer, traditionally rare in young people, began to show increased incidence in adults under 50. This definition gained prominence from the 2000s onwards, especially in international epidemiological studies, to differentiate tumors that arise early from those that occur at older ages. The goal is to facilitate surveillance, research, and the development of prevention and early diagnosis strategies for this group, which has distinct clinical characteristics, risk factors, and needs.

The importance of maintaining epidemiological surveillance in this age group is growing, as early diagnosis can significantly impact prognosis and quality of life. In addition, understanding the factors associated with the increase in these tumors can help guide public policies and preventive interventions.

## How do we know incidence is rising?

Multiple population-based cancer registries worldwide have shown a consistent increase in the incidence of several types of early-onset cancer since the 1990s. The 2022 article analyzed data from 44 countries and found that, between 1990 and 2019, there was a significant rise in tumors such as colorectal, breast, kidney, liver, pancreas, stomach, and others.

For example, the incidence of colorectal cancer in people under 50 has increased by about 2% per year in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, China, and Japan. In the US, the incidence of colorectal cancer in adults aged 20 to 49 rose from about 8 to 13 cases per 100,000 between 1990 and 2019. In the UK, the increase was 48% between 1993 and 2018 for adults aged 25 to 49. In China, colorectal cancer in young people increased by 70% between 1990 and 2019, according to Global Burden of Disease data and the 2024 Chinese article.

Early-onset breast cancer has also increased in several countries. In South Korea, the incidence in women aged 20 to 39 doubled between 1999 and 2019. In Brazil, data from INCA show a 30% increase in breast cancer incidence in women aged 20 to 49 between 2000 and 2020.

Other tumors with relevant growth include pancreatic, kidney, liver, and stomach cancers. The 2024 Lancet Public Health article highlights that, in low- and middle-income countries such as India and South Africa, there is also an increase in gastrointestinal cancers in young adults, although absolute numbers are still lower than in developed countries.

These data show that the phenomenon of early-onset cancer is global, affecting different regions and socioeconomic contexts, and is not restricted to the developed world.

## Which cancer types are rising fastest?

Gastrointestinal tumors are the most notable for their increase, especially colorectal, pancreas, stomach, and, notably, biliary tract tumors (such as cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer). The Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology article and Global Cancer Statistics 2024 data show that, in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, China, and Japan, the incidence of biliary tract cancer in adults under 50 has increased by 3% to 5% per year in recent decades. In South Korea and Japan, early-onset stomach cancer has also grown significantly, while in Western countries the highlight is colorectal cancer.

Early-onset pancreatic cancer, although still rare, has doubled its incidence in young adults in countries such as Australia, the United States, and China since the 1990s. Liver cancer has also increased, especially in regions of Asia and Africa, where factors such as viral hepatitis and metabolic changes play an important role.

Early-onset breast cancer is rising more in Asian countries (South Korea, China, Japan), while in Western countries the increase is more modest. Kidney and thyroid tumors are also increasing, especially in North America and Europe.

These regional differences reflect both environmental and behavioral factors as well as screening patterns, diet, and infection prevalence.

## How recent are these data and which regions are most affected?

Most available data cover the period from 1990 to 2019, with some updates to 2022 in national and international registries. The increase in early-onset cancer incidence is most pronounced in high-income countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and South Korea, but is also observed in middle- and low-income countries such as China, India, Brazil, and South Africa. For example, the 2024 Chinese article ([DOI: 10.1007/s11427-023-2445-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-023-2445-1)) highlights that Asia, especially China and Japan, has seen rapid growth in colorectal, gastric, and biliary cancers in young people. In Latin America, data from Brazil show a significant increase in breast and colorectal cancer in adults under 50. In South Africa and India, the growth of gastrointestinal tumors is also notable, although absolute numbers are lower.

These findings reinforce that the phenomenon of early-onset cancer is global, with growing impact across continents and socioeconomic contexts, requiring coordinated international surveillance and response.

## Why is this happening? Theories for the causes

There is no single explanation for the increase in early-onset cancer, but the main articles highlight several hypotheses. Below are the main ideas discussed in the recent literature and the degree of consensus among publications:

- **Lifestyle changes** (consensus): increased sedentary behavior, obesity, diets high in ultra-processed foods and low in fiber are pointed out as central factors in all articles analyzed.

- **Early exposure to environmental and behavioral risk factors** (consensus): exposure to pollutants, passive smoking, alcohol, endocrine disruptors, and other environmental agents since childhood/adolescence.

- **Alterations in the gut microbiome** (strong emphasis in the 2022 and 2024 articles): changes in the microbiome, possibly related to diet, antibiotic use, and cesarean sections, may influence cancer risk.

- **Use of antibiotics and other medications in childhood** (moderate consensus): suggested as a risk factor in several studies, but still with indirect evidence.

- **Genetic and epigenetic factors** (partial consensus): although genetic syndromes explain few cases, epigenetic changes induced by environment and lifestyle are increasingly discussed.

- **Sleep, circadian rhythm, and exposure to artificial light** (cited in some articles): changes in sleep patterns and exposure to light at night may play a role in cancer risk, especially in urban populations.

- **Viral and bacterial infections** (cited in Asian studies): hepatitis, H. pylori, and other infectious agents are relevant for liver and gastric tumors in specific regions.

The 2022 British Journal of Cancer article ([DOI: 10.1038/s41416-022-01704-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-022-01704-x)) reinforces that most cases are not explained by known genetic syndromes, suggesting an important role for environmental and behavioral factors acquired in the first decades of life. The 2022 Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology article and the 2024 Science China Life Sciences article emphasize the role of the microbiome, diet, and early exposures as central factors.

## What does this mean for public health?

The rise in early-onset cancer represents a growing challenge for health systems worldwide. These patients have specific needs, may be underdiagnosed due to low clinical suspicion, and often face barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Strategies for prevention, early diagnosis, and research into causes are urgently needed.

### Perspectives: what can we expect for the future?

There are still many uncertainties about the future incidence of early-onset cancer. Current data suggest that the upward trend may continue, especially if environmental and behavioral factors are not modified at the population level. However, understanding of the causes is still limited, and there is a need for longitudinal studies, investigations into early-life exposures, and research that integrates genetic, environmental, and microbiome data.

It is possible that, with greater awareness, public health policies, and advances in screening and prevention, it will be possible to reverse or at least slow this trend. On the other hand, without structural changes and more knowledge about the mechanisms involved, the increase may persist in the coming decades. Therefore, the scenario requires continuous epidemiological surveillance, international collaboration, and investment in multidisciplinary research.
