In the last issue of <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>, a team from the National University of Singapore report the intriguing finding that intracellular tumor antigenâ€“specific monoclonal antibodies could inhibit tumor                         growth and metastasis and prolong survival of tumor-bearing mice. As this is a dogma-challenging discovery, a lot of questions naturally arise. Just how the antibodies directed to intracellular proteins managed to effect cell toxicity? Are these results possibly reproducible in humans? Could this be a whole new monoclonal antibody-based strategy for cancer treatment? Antibody-based therapies are targeted at specific molecular elements of cells (often receptor proteins) and thus have improved safety over standard chemotherapy regimens, which has resulted                         in extended survival and improved quality of  life for cancer patients with conventional treatment refractoriness. Because antibodies are too large to  cross intact cell membrane and access                         intracellular locations, antibody therapy has  traditionally targeted extracellular or secreted proteins expressed by  cancer                         cells. However, many oncogenic proteins are  found within the cell (such as intracellular phosphatases/kinases and  transcription                         factors) and have therefore not been targets for  usual antibody therapies. In their proof-of-concept experiment, researchers have treated animals with antibodies directed at intracellular proteins or with endogenous antibody formation by vaccination with these protein products. As a result, they obtained<i> in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tumor growth inhibition with this strategy. Theoretical possibilities to explain these unexpected effects could be: (1) a small fraction of intracellular antigens may be released due to necrosis or cancer cell lysis; (2) some intracellular antigens may be externalized and displayed on the surface of cancer cells by unconventional secretion; (3) binding of antibodies to surface-exposed intracellular proteins may then trigger immune responses such as ADCC to destroy the cancer cells; (4) antibodies could be taken up by the cancer cells in an antigen-specific manner; (5) complement-mediated events may also be involved. Truly, this effect remains a mistery to be explained, but with plenty of promise if could be confirmed and translated to human patients.<br />Read the complete article: <a href="https://bit.ly/nT1HbL">https://bit.ly/nT1HbL</a>
