We <br />conducted a study to determine whether treatment with zoledronic acid, <br />in addition to standard adjuvant therapy, would improve disease outcomes<br /> in such patients.</div><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><h3 id="abstractMethods">Methods</h3>In this open-label phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 3360 patients to <br />receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy either with or without <br />zoledronic acid. The zoledronic acid was administered every 3 to 4 weeks<br /> for 6 doses and then every 3 to 6 months to complete 5 years of <br />treatment. The primary end point of the study was disease-free survival.<br /> A second interim analysis revealed that a prespecified boundary for <br />lack of benefit had been crossed.</div><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><h3 id="abstractResults">Results</h3>At a median follow-up of 59 months, there was no significant between-group<br /> difference in the primary end point, with a rate of disease-free <br />survival of 77% in each group (adjusted hazard ratio in the zoledronic <br />acid group, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.13; P=0.79). <br />Disease recurrence or death occurred in 377 patients in the zoledronic <br />acid group and 375 of those in the control group. The numbers of deaths —<br /> 243 in the zoledronic acid group and 276 in the control group — were <br />also similar, resulting in rates of overall survival of 85.4% in the <br />zoledronic acid group and 83.1% in the control group (adjusted hazard <br />ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.01; P=0.07). In the zoledronic acid <br />group, there were 17 confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw <br />(cumulative incidence, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.7; P&lt;0.001) and 9 <br />suspected cases; there were no cases in the control group. Rates of <br />other adverse effects were similar in the two study groups.</div><div class="section"></div><h3 id="abstractConclusions">Conclusions</h3>These findings do not support the routine use of zoledronic acid in the <br />adjuvant management of breast cancer.
