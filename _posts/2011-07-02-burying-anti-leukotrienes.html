A recently published meta-analisys from Cochrane Database has reported that anti-leukotriene drugs fare worse than long-acting beta2-adrenergics when treating adults with inhaled-corticosteroid resistant asthma. Although this report coi√≥s not conclude anything for children, anti-leukotrienes are known to have limited value in pediatric asthma. This result makes an even stronger case for the fail that was the anti-leukotriene therapy, once a hype of Big Pharma.
