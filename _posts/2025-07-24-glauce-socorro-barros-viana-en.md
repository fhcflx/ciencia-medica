## Education and Career

Glauce Viana graduated in Pharmacy from the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), where she also completed her master's degree in Pharmacology{% include farmacologia-en.html %}. She earned her PhD in Pharmacology from the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), consolidating her academic training in one of the most innovative areas of contemporary science.

Since 1982, she has been a professor at UFC, responsible for creating and coordinating the Laboratory of Neurosciences (LabNeuro-UFC), one of the main neuroscience research centers{% include neuroscience-en.html %} in the Northeast of Brazil. The laboratory stands out for studies on neurobiological mechanisms of diseases such as epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and pain, as well as research on neuroprotection and neuroplasticity.

## Scientific Contributions

Throughout her career, Glauce Viana has published dozens of scientific articles in national and international journals, supervised many dozens of master's and doctoral students, and participated in innovative research projects. Her work is recognized for investigations into the role of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurotrophic factors in physiological and pathological processes of the nervous system.

In addition to research, she is known for her commitment to training young scientists, having mentored and inspired generations of researchers in Ceará and Brazil. Her work has contributed to strengthening neuroscience in the Northeast and to the internationalization of Brazilian research.

Internationally, Dr. Glauce Viana has more than 3,000 academic citations and dozens of articles published in high-impact scientific journals, according to Google Scholar ([profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3nGfmtUAAAAJ&hl=en)). Her research covers topics such as neuroprotection, pharmacology of neurodegenerative diseases (including Parkinson's), the gut-brain-microbiome axis{% include microbiome-en.html %}, seizures, effects of natural and synthetic compounds on the nervous system, and pharmacovigilance. Recent works include studies on the role of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease ([Ageing Research Reviews, 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455790/)), neuroprotective effects of natural substances, and investigations into the use of cannabis and vitamin D3 in neurodegenerative diseases. Her scientific output is internationally recognized, contributing to advances in translational and clinical neuroscience.

Among Dr. Glauce Viana's most impactful international works are:

**Role of enteric glia and microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson disease pathogenesis** (Ageing Research Reviews, 2023): Review on the role of the gut-brain-microbiome axis in Parkinson's disease. [Read article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455790/).

I am proud to have been co-supervised by Glauce Viana during my master's degree, conducting part of the experiments in her laboratory. There, I learned the technique of stereotaxy{% include stereotaxy-en.html %} in experimental animals with Dr. Geanne Matos Cunha, a fundamental experience for my scientific training. The resulting work was published in Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria ([article](https://www.scielo.br/j/anp/a/htnPkB8snm5JMMhRNSGkvrd/?lang=en)), and the dissertation is available at the [UFC Repository](https://repositorio.ufc.br/handle/riufc/2360).

## Recognition and Honors

Glauce Viana has received several honors throughout her career, including academic awards and public recognition. In 2023, she was honored by the Legislative Assembly of Ceará for her contribution to science and education, highlighting the role of women in scientific research. She is also a member of the Ceará Academy of Sciences (ACECI) and the Ceará Academy of Pharmacy.

## Social Impact and Education

In addition to her scientific work, Glauce Viana is engaged in science communication{% include divulgacao-cientifica-en.html %} and education projects, promoting access to knowledge and encouraging women's participation in science. Her work inspires young students and researchers, reinforcing the importance of diversity and inclusion in the academic environment.
