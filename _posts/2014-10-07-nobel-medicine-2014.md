The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared by scientists Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser (Norway), and John O’Keefe (UK) for their work on spatial orientation cells in the brain.

O'Keefe demonstrated the existence of place cells in the brain region called the hippocampus, an area best known as one of the most important memory centers. The Mosers, in turn, discovered a type of cell in a nearby structure, the entorhinal cortex, capable of "projecting" a virtual map—a "grid" of spatial locations. These grid cells provide information about the environment to the hippocampal place cells, allowing animals to orient themselves in space.

When O'Keefe began his experiments in the 1960s, neuroscientists doubted that neuronal activity could be associated with any type of behavior. He was surprised to discover that hippocampal neurons fired when experimental animals moved and changed location. He theorized that the collective activity of these cells formed an "internal map" that helped the animal locate itself in space.

However, until the Mosers' discovery, it was unknown where the information feeding the place cells came from. They found that grid cells fire in different locations of a virtual hexagonal pattern, created entirely in the brain, forming a "virtual map." This was the first demonstration of such a virtual system in the brain. Experts say that, had someone suggested the existence of such a system before this discovery, they would have been considered crazy.
