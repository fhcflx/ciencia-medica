<h3 id="abstractBackground">Background</h3>Acute myeloid leukemia  (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to presentation and  clinical outcome. The prognostic value of recently identified somatic  mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of  treatment for AML.<br />
<!--more-->


<h3 id="abstractMethods">Methods</h3>We performed a mutational  analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who  had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with  high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic  findings in an independent set of 104 patients.<br /><div class="section"> </div><div class="section"> <h3 id="abstractResults">Results</h3>We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in <em>FLT3</em> (<em>FLT3</em>-ITD), partial tandem duplication in <em>MLL</em> (<em>MLL-</em>PTD), and mutations in <em>ASXL1</em> and <em>PHF6</em> were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for <em>FLT3</em>-ITD, P=0.009 for <em>MLL-</em>PTD, P=0.05 for <em>ASXL1,</em> and P=0.006 for <em>PHF6</em>); <em>CEBPA</em> and <em>IDH2</em> mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for <em>CEBPA</em> and P=0.01 for <em>IDH2</em>). The favorable effect of <em>NPM1</em> mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring <em>NPM1</em> and <em>IDH1</em> or <em>IDH2</em>  mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved  risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age,  white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and  validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort.  High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin,  improved the rate of survival among patients with <em>DNMT3A</em> or <em>NPM1</em> mutations or <em>MLL</em> translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type <em>DNMT3A, NPM1,</em> and <em>MLL</em> (P=0.67).<br /><h3 id="abstractConclusions">Conclusions</h3>We found that <em>DNMT3A</em> and <em>NPM1</em> mutations and <em>MLL</em>  translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction  chemotherapy in patients with AML. These findings suggest that  mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification  and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients  with AML.
