<p>A study published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.03.032">Neuron</a> in 2025 and discussed on the TWIM (This Week in Microbiology) podcast on May 27th brought new evidence about the relationship between the gut microbiome and chronic pain in fibromyalgia. The work shows that changes in gut bacteria may not only be associated with, but also directly contribute to, pain and other symptoms of the disease.

<h2 id="introduction-what-is-fibromyalgia-and-why-does-the-microbiome-matter">Introduction: What is fibromyalgia and why does the microbiome matter?</h2>

<p>Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome, marked by widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties, mainly affecting women. It is estimated that fibromyalgia affects about 2% to 4% of the world population, being more prevalent in women between 30 and 60 years old. In Brazil, this represents millions of people living with chronic pain and a significant impact on quality of life, productivity, and healthcare costs. <b>Fibromyalgia: epidemiology</b><br />
Fibromyalgia affects about 2% to 4% of the world population, with a higher prevalence in women between 30 and 60 years old. It is a major cause of chronic pain and disability, impacting quality of life and generating significant healthcare costs worldwide.
 Despite its high prevalence, the causes of fibromyalgia are still poorly understood and available treatments are often unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><strong>Why does the microbiome matter for health?</strong></p>

<p>The gut microbiome is the set of trillions of microorganisms (mainly bacteria) that live in our digestive tract. It acts as a true “biochemical factory,” helping digest food, produce vitamins, regulate the immune system, and protect against infectious agents. In addition, the microbiome communicates with the brain through chemical substances and the enteric nervous system, influencing mood, metabolism, and even pain perception. Changes in the balance of these bacteria (dysbiosis) have been associated with several diseases, including metabolic, autoimmune, psychiatric disorders, and chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia. <b>Gut microbiome</b><br />
The gut microbiome is the community of trillions of microorganisms (mainly bacteria) that inhabit our digestive tract. It plays a key role in digestion, vitamin production, immune regulation, and even communication with the brain, influencing mood, metabolism, and pain perception.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiome—the set of trillions of bacteria living in our intestines—can influence the functioning of the nervous and immune systems, even affecting pain perception.</p>

<h2 id="methods-how-was-the-study-conducted">Methods: How was the study conducted?</h2>

<p>The researchers transplanted the microbiome (gut bacteria) from women with fibromyalgia into germ-free mice, comparing with transplants from healthy individuals. They also conducted a small open clinical study, in which women with fibromyalgia received microbiota transplants from healthy donors after antibiotic and bowel preparation.</p>

<h2 id="main-results">Main results</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In mice:</strong> Transplanting microbiota from fibromyalgia patients induced persistent pain, immune system changes, metabolic alterations, and reduced skin innervation—all phenomena similar to those observed in human patients. The mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical, thermal (heat and cold), and spontaneous pain, without motor or cognitive changes. The study also showed that the patients’ microbiota led to changes in immune cells, activation of microglia in the spinal cord (cells involved in chronic pain), and changes in metabolites such as bile acids and neuroactive amino acids. <b>Microglia</b><br />
Microglia are immune cells of the central nervous system, responsible for monitoring and responding to changes in the brain and spinal cord. They play a crucial role in neuroinflammation and are involved in the mechanisms of chronic pain.
 When the mice later received microbiota from healthy people, the pain was reversed and part of the metabolic and immune changes returned to normal, suggesting a causal role of the microbiome in chronic pain in fibromyalgia.</li>
  <li><strong>Reversal:</strong> When the mice subsequently received healthy microbiota, the pain was relieved.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In the clinical study:</strong> Women with severe, treatment-resistant fibromyalgia showed significant pain reduction and improved quality of life after receiving healthy microbiota transplants. The open clinical study involved 14 women, who received capsules of microbiota from healthy donors after bowel preparation. There was an average drop of 2 points on the pain scale (NRS), improvement in global disease impact (FIQ), reduction in anxiety and depression, better sleep, and improved physical quality of life. Sensory tests showed increased cold pain threshold and a trend toward improvement in heat pain. The metabolic profile and microbiome composition also changed, becoming more similar to the donors’. Adverse effects were mild and transient, mainly fatigue and mild gastrointestinal symptoms. <b>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)</b><br />
FMT is a procedure in which gut bacteria from a healthy donor are transferred to the intestine of a patient, aiming to restore the balance of the microbiome. It is being studied as a potential therapy for various diseases, including chronic pain conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="significance-for-the-field-and-for-patients">Significance for the field and for patients</h2>

<p>The study provides evidence that the gut microbiome is not just a “bystander” in fibromyalgia, but may be one of the factors causing or perpetuating chronic pain. This opens the way for new therapeutic approaches, such as microbiota transplantation or the use of specific probiotics, and reinforces the importance of research on the relationship between the gut, immune system, and brain. <b>Probiotics</b><br />
Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits to the host. They can help modulate the gut microbiome and are being investigated as a therapeutic option for several conditions, including chronic pain and fibromyalgia.</p>

<p>Despite the promising results, it is important to remember that the clinical study was small and open-label (without a control group), and more research is needed before microbiota transplantation can be routinely recommended. Still, the work represents an important advance in understanding fibromyalgia and may inspire new strategies to treat chronic pain.</p>

<p><strong>What is TWiM?</strong></p>

<p>TWiM (This Week in Microbiology) is a podcast created by virologist Vincent Racaniello, from Columbia University (USA), in 2010. The program discusses weekly advances and curiosities in microbiology, focusing on recent scientific articles and topics relevant to health and science. The regular members include:</p>
