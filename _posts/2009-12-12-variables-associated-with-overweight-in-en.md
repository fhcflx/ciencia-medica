OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and the main factors associated with overweight and obesity in children living in a slum area in the northeast of Brazil.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 86 children (40 eutrophic and 46 overweight/obese) aged 5 to 9 years selected among 508 children in this age group evaluated and registered in the Family Health Unit (Unidade Saúde da Família, USF). Overweight/obesity were defined according to the cutoff points established by Cole et al were used. Biological and socioeconomic variables, dietary habits, time spent on television, and sedentary habits were analyzed. Association tests were conducted to analyze the data. Significance was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight/obesity among the 508 children was 13%. Excessive calorie intake, consumption of artificially sweetened drinks, and sedentary habits were significantly associated with overweight and obesity.

CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight/obesity was high in the group assessed and it was associated with excessive calorie intake, consumption of artificially sweetened drinks and sedentary lifestyle. These factors should be taken into consideration in the planning and development of interventions and prevention strategies.
