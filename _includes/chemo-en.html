<span class="sidenote">Chemotherapy refers to the treatment of diseases with chemical substances that affect cell function. It can be antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer, etc. In common usage, chemotherapy means anticancer or antineoplastic therapy, a cancer treatment using drugs that can induce cell death. Cancer cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy because they multiply rapidly. However, normal cells can also be affected, causing various side effects such as hair loss.</span>
