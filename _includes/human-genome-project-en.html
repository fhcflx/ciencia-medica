<span class="sidenote">Human Genome Project (HGP): an international consortium that involved more than 5,000 researchers from 50 countries, aiming to sequence the entire human genome (the set of all genes). Planned since the 1980s, it began in 1990 under the direction of James D. Watson (one of the discoverers of the DNA structure) as a program of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). The project was expected to take 15 years and cost $3 billion to sequence about 100,000 genes. In 2003, a joint press release announced the official completion of the project, which sequenced 99% of the human genome with 99.99% accuracy, finding about 22,300 genes, much fewer than initially expected.</span>
