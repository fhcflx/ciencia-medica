A japanese group has published a retrospective evaluation of neuroblastoma mass-screening program that was performed
between 1984 and 2003. They reported that this program was effective for more neuroblastoma diagnosis and less mortality,
suggesting that previous accounts that it did not affect patients mortality were not true. These results indicate that
neuroblastoma mass-screening with quantitative methods can effectively diminish the diagnosis of late-stage disease and
help reduce mortality in children with this disease. Read the article <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2960523-1/fulltext">
