_Nobel Prize medal (all rights reserved to the Nobel Foundation)_

In September and October 2024, some thousands of academics and public figures around the world received invitation letters to nominate candidates for the 2025 Nobel Prize. Nominations were accepted until the end of January this year. From that point, members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy and the Swedish Parliament began a process that lasted almost the whole year and will conclude with the selection of the 2025 Nobel laureates in the week starting 6 October, Monday. During this period they met many times, wrote detailed reports, consulted experts worldwide and debated among themselves. From 6 October they will present their proposals to the members of the Academies, the Assemblies and the Parliament, who will vote on the winners. Immediately afterward, up to three people will receive the famous phone calls informing them of the prize.

The rules of the Nobel Foundation do not allow disclosure of the nominators, the nominees or documents from the selection process for 50 years. The Norwegian Nobel Committee reported receiving 338 nominations for this year's Peace Prize, including 197 individuals and 89 organizations. The committees of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which choose the winners of the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry and Economic Sciences, do not disclose the number of nominees. The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, responsible for selecting the laureates in Physiology or Medicine, also does not disclose numbers, nor does the Swedish Academy, which chooses the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Nevertheless, we do not have to be completely in the dark about who the possible laureates might be.

## Academia predictions

Below are the names that have appeared in surveys and specialist articles — with a brief note on the profile and the work that places them among possible laureates.

## Nobel Prize in Chemistry

The online magazine [ChemistryViews][chem], published by Chemistry Europe (which brings together 16 European chemical societies), usually runs a poll among its readers about who the likely winners would be. For 2025, these were the names highlighted in that survey:

## AI predictions


I experimented with a somewhat convoluted prompt using Copilot (GPT-5) to create a list of "laureates". The result must be judged by each reader (I revised some incorrect information, but some may remain). I actually found it quite fun. Here are the AI's predictions for the 2025 Nobel:

Note: The AI had included some names that I removed, but they made me think. They are PhD students, postdocs, or recently finished, very young, the kind of people who do not usually appear on these lists. The reason the AI chose these people escapes me, especially since much of the content about them (training and affiliations, for example, but not the topic of their work) was invented. One of the AI's nominees, Jeffrey Cohen, had incorrect information about his research topics (he works with herpesviruses, but the AI reported it was HIV), and I rewrote it. The AI indicated a name very connected to industry in Europe, Patrick Courtney, which also escapes the more obvious type of nomination we see in these lists. I kept his name; see what you think the AI had in mind when nominating someone who leads work in automation and robotics...
