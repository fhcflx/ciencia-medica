<span class="sidenote">Mutation (from Latin mutatio = change): in biology, alterations of the cell's genetic material. Mutations can be classified in several ways. For example, silent mutations do not change the expression of the genetic code and therefore have no effect on cell structure or metabolism. Point mutations involve the change of a single nucleotide in the chain, while deletions remove a part of the chain and insertions add a segment of nucleotides.</span>
