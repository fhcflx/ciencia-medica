The work of biophysicist David Brenner (Columbia University&#39;s Center for Radiological Research Director) has sparked controversy in the field. In a 2001 paper, he tried to weight the risks of radiation exposure in CT scans and found that children that received radiation from a single CT scan had an estimated 1 in 1000 risk of developing a fatal cancer in the future. Although this seems little, given that an average 600,000 abdominal and head CT scans were performed yearly on children by the time of this publication, the predicted number of cancer fatalities possibly linked to CT radiation exposure could reach 500 a year. This conclusion was headlines in all USA and raised angered reactions of many medical physicists and radiologists.
