Via ScienceNOW: Robotic avatars of disabled people walking around and interacting with other people? This possibility has now a little more of science and a little less of fiction due to a new development reported at IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society conference in Boston. A group from  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland has devised a way of merging human-driven control and robotic control to create a smooth form of subconcious remote thought control. People wearing an array of tiny electrodes in a cap could control the movements of a robot a 100-mile away almost as easily as we can control our own  movements. This new non-invasive technology will be next tested in locked-in patients that lack any possibility of movement. This new development can open the way to a new era for disabled patients and their relation to other people.<br />Read the news (ScienceNow blog):<br /><br /><a href="https://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/09/disabled-patients-mind-meld-with.html?ref=em&amp;elq=7974b8796cf14927b8cf439f1f023218#.TmadaUH4_FY.blogger">Disabled Patients Mind-Meld With Robots - ScienceNOW</a>
