<span class="sidenote">Gene: a segment of DNA that encodes a molecule (usually a protein) with a specific function. Genes are the units of inheritance first hypothesized by Mendel and named by the Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909. Genes make up only a small fraction of a cell's DNA; most DNA does not code for proteins and is not part of genes. The phrase "one gene, one protein" summarizes the central dogma of biology: genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA and then to a protein.</span>
