<strong>Interplanetary magnetic field:</strong> is the magnetic field that permeates the space between the planets of the solar system. It is mainly generated by the Sun and is an extension of the solar magnetic field, which stretches beyond the heliosphere, the region dominated by the solar wind. The interplanetary magnetic field influences the movement of charged particles in space, affects space weather conditions, and interacts with the magnetic fields of planets, including Earth. This field is crucial for protecting Earth against cosmic radiation and solar particles, and also plays an important role in the formation of auroras and other space phenomena.
