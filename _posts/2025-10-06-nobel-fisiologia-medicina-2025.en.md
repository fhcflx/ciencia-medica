Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance." The laureates' research clarified how the immune system avoids attacking the body's own tissues — a mechanism essential to prevent autoimmune disease — through a specialized subset of T lymphocytes now known as regulatory T cells (Tregs).

## Summary of the findings

**Mary E. Brunkow** — Ph.D. from Princeton; key work identifying mutations that cause loss of immune tolerance in animal models; currently affiliated with the Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, USA.

**Fred Ramsdell** — Ph.D. (UCLA); central contributions to identifying the FOXP3 gene and its relationship to autoimmune phenotypes; works as scientific/business consultant in biotechnology.

**Shimon Sakaguchi** — M.D./Ph.D. (Kyoto University); discovered the role of Tregs in peripheral tolerance and demonstrated how their absence or dysfunction leads to autoimmunity; professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Japan.

Shimon Sakaguchi made the first decisive discovery in 1995 by identifying a population of T cells with regulatory function — cells that limit potentially harmful immune responses. Later, Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell identified the mutation responsible for an autoimmune phenotype in mice (the FOXP3 gene) and showed that alterations in the homologous gene in humans cause severe autoimmune syndromes (e.g., IPEX). The link between FOXP3 and the development/function of Tregs established a new field of research: peripheral tolerance.

## Why this matters

The laureates' work changed our understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the immune system from attacking the organism itself. The implications are vast: manipulating Tregs is now a promising strategy both in autoimmune diseases (where the goal is to strengthen tolerance) and in oncology (where it may be necessary to dampen these cells' action to improve antitumor responses). Moreover, advances in immune tolerance may make transplants safer and reduce the need for chronic immunosuppression.

Think of the immune system as an army whose job is to protect the body. To avoid collateral damage (for example, attacking the body's own cells), besides training soldiers to recognize enemies, the body has oversight officers — the Tregs. They act as a brake: when the immune response is too strong or misdirected against self, Tregs intervene and tone down the reaction.

The awarded discoveries show:

1) that there is a specific type of cell whose main function is to suppress dangerous responses outside the primary formation site (so-called peripheral tolerance);
2) that a gene called FOXP3 is essential for these cells to exist and function correctly. Without FOXP3, the system loses its brake and attacks against self occur (autoimmune diseases).

The most studied Tregs are CD4+CD25+FOXP3+. FOXP3 is the transcription factor that programs the fate and suppressive function of these cells.
There are mechanisms of central tolerance (in the thymus) and peripheral tolerance (outside the thymus). Sakaguchi and others showed that part of the regulatory population is generated in the thymus, but that there are also peripherally induced Tregs derived from conventional T cells under certain signals (TGF-β, IL-2).
Mechanisms of suppression: Tregs employ multiple mechanisms — production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), expression of CTLA-4 that modulates antigen-presenting cells, local consumption of IL-2 (depriving other cells), and metabolic alteration of the microenvironment (e.g., adenosine production via CD39/CD73).
Transfer experiments, mouse models with FOXP3 deletion (the "scurfy" phenotype in mice) and clinical findings in IPEX (a human syndrome associated with FOXP3 mutations) were crucial to establish causality.

## Clinical implications and applications

Autoimmunity: understanding Tregs and FOXP3 allows identification of causes of syndromes such as IPEX, and points to strategies to restore tolerance in autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes).

Oncology: tumors often recruit or induce Tregs to suppress antitumor responses; modulating Tregs may improve the efficacy of immunotherapies (checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines).

Transplantation: Treg-based therapies (Treg infusion, protocols to expand them) are being tested to reduce rejection and decrease the use of broad-spectrum immunosuppressants.

Emerging therapeutics: approaches include ex vivo expansion of Tregs, engineering Tregs with specific receptors (CAR-Tregs), and drugs that modulate key pathways (low-dose IL-2 to favor Tregs).
