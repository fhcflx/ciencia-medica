In infants and children with intermediate risk neuroblastoma, a reduced-intensity chemotherapy regimen yields survival
rates comparable to or better than a more aggressive regimen typically used in this patient population, researchers report.

In a study of 467 neuroblastoma patients, 192 received 4 cycles of chemotherapy in 64 days (the less intense arm) and 275
received 8 cycles in 168 days (the standard arm), following surgery. Chemotherapy consisted of 2 to 3 drug combinations of
carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.

"The bottom line is that with significantly less intense chemotherapy, we achieved 3-year overall survival of 96%," Dr.
David L. Baker told the 43rd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
