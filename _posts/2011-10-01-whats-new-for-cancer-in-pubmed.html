These were (1) vincristine and escalating IV methotrexate (MTX) without  leucovorin rescue during the interim maintenance (IM) phases and (2)  addition of a second delayed intensification (DI) phase. Eligible  patients (n = 2078) were randomly assigned to regimens containing either  oral (PO) MTX, PO mercaptopurine, dexamethasone, and vincristine or IV  MTX during IM phases, and regimens with either single DI or double DI.  Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival for patients on  the PO MTX arms were 88.7% ± 1.4% and 96% ± 0.9% versus 92.6% ± 1.2%  and 96.5% ± 0.8% for those on the IV MTX arms (P = .009, P = .66).  Five-year EFS and overall survival for patients who received single DI  were 90.9% ± 1.3% and 97.1% ± 0.8% versus 90.5% ± 1.3% and 95.4% ± 3.8%  for those who received double DI (P = .71, P = .12). No advantage was  found for a second DI; however, replacement of PO MTX, PO  mercaptopurine, vincristine, and dexamethasone during IM with  vincristine and escalating IV MTX improved EFS.<br />PMID: 21562038 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]<br /><br />Ful text: <a href="https://bit.ly/qeHiwx">https://bit.ly/qeHiwx </a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="10"><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
