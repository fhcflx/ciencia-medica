Small studies in humans indicate  potential for therapeutic anticancer effects and warrant further larger  studies.<br /><h4> METHODS: </h4>A case-control study using the General  Practice Research Database examined whether prior ACE inhibitor usage  was associated with a reduction in incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC).<br /><h4> RESULTS: </h4>Two hundred twenty-four HCC cases were  identified, each matched to up to 10 controls by age, sex, and general  practice. The data show that HCC is associated with a small,  nonsignificant increase in prior use of ACE inhibitors (OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.16,  CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.67-2.00). ACE inhibitor use was 7.1% (of 224) in cases and 5.9%  (of 2,313) in controls. No significant effects were found when  investigating the effect of dose and exposure duration.<br /><h4> CONCLUSIONS: </h4>We  found no clear protective effect of ever or long term use of ACE  inhibitors against the development of HCC. Our study suggests that it is  unlikely that this class of drugs will be a clinically useful cancer  chemoprevention therapy.</div><br />PMID: 21909951 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="10"><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
