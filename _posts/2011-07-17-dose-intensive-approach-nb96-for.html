Results from a french pilot trial testing very high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation in children with advanced neuroblastoma were not different from previous trials with other approaches. Survival in this group of patients remained between 30-40% in 5 years. New treatments are needed for kids with advanced neuroblastoma.<br /><br /><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pbc.23232/abstract;jsessionid=6E32893655657F997779091C73FD6B63.d03t04">A dose-intensive approach (NB96) for induction therapy utilizing sequential high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue in high-risk neuroblastoma in children over 1 year of age - Monnereau-Laborde - 2011 - Pediatric Blood &amp; Cancer - Wiley Online Library</a>
