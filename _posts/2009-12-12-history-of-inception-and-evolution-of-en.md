**[The history of the inception and evolution of psychological care for infants and their families in a Neonatal Unit](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-05822009000300017).** Set√∫bal, MSV. Rev. Paul. pediatr. 27 (3), 2009.

OBJECTIVE: This article describes the evolution of a psychologist's work in a Neonatal Care Unit, from simple interventions that changed certain routines to foster humanization of care, to the complete integration of this professional into the multidisciplinary neonatal team. Detailed descriptions of the work's implementation in the hospital setting offer health professionals of the field a model for similar programs.

CASE DESCRIPTION: The history of the inception and evolution of a psychologist's work at the Neonatal Care Unit of Universidade Estadual de Campinas in a ten-year period (1993 to 2003) was described. Specific activities developed within this period have been described, as well as the theory supporting every action. The base techniques utilized within this time frame are also commented.

COMMENTS: The specificity of the psychologist's knowledge can be extended to other health professionals of the same field, promoting preventive mental health measures, especially actions that benefit the bonding between mothers and their babies. It could also be disseminated, grow in importance, and become routine in every neonatal care unit.
