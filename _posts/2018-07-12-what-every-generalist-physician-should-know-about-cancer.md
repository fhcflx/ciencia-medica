excerpt: "A practical guide for generalist physicians on the human and technical approach to breaking a cancer diagnosis, debunking myths and reinforcing the generalist's key role."

In this text, I aim to show that, often, even with adequate knowledge on the subject, a generalist physician can do even more and make a difference for cancer patients by paying attention to certain details and organizing an objective and humane approach.

The vast majority of patients who discover they have cancer{% include cancer.html %} will initially be seen by a generalist physician{% include generalist-en.html %}. This includes internists, pediatricians, general surgeons, and OB-GYNs. We doctors spend a long time in medical school learning how cancer arises, its mechanisms, biology, symptoms, and other academic details. However, this wealth of information does not always help when it comes to communicating with patients about a suspected neoplastic disease.

One of the gaps in most medical school curricula is teaching the doctor-patient relationship, especially how to communicate a bad diagnosis{% include diagnosis-en.html %}. Many professionals are left to rely on their own experience and interpersonal skills, which is not always enough. Ideally, alongside technical knowledge about the disease, humane communication should also be trained. Unfortunately, this is not the norm today.

This means that all the knowledge acquired in school does not always help when it comes to communicating with patients. Therefore, a brief guide to the minimum necessary to know about cancer and how to talk to patients is very useful. In this short text, I will share what I believe should be a priority for generalist physicians who may encounter suspected neoplasms.

## Myths about cancer (for generalist physicians)

### I will never see a case of cancer in my practice; it's very rare

Not true. Most generalists will encounter suspected cases, and not just once. Cancer is a disease whose incidence is increasing due to population aging and other factors. *It is increasingly common to find suspected cases in daily practice.*

### No one survives cancer

That is a thing of the past. Until the 1970s-80s, survival was not very promising for most types of cancer. Today, with advances in epidemiology{% include epidemio.html %}, early diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, *the norm is to survive cancer; most patients have diseases that can be adequately treated if discovered in time.*

### Cancer treatment is very expensive

While it is true that the latest treatments are very costly, treatment for most cancer patients can be carried out at an acceptable cost in our country. Where treatment is not available, citizens have the right to be referred to a place where it is. As stipulated in our constitution, *it is everyone's right to have this guaranteed by the public authorities.*

### I am a generalist, there is nothing I can do

This is the biggest myth of all. One of medicine's greatest weapons against cancer is early diagnosis, and in this process, the main role is played by generalists. So yes, if you work in a health center, as a general surgeon in a small hospital, or in a rural maternity ward, you have the greatest power of all in the fight against cancer: *recognizing it as early as possible saves the greatest number of lives.*

## Truths about cancer

### It is a serious disease

Yes, and for this reason, diagnosis and treatment should not be delayed. If, for myocardial infarction{% include infarto.html %} or stroke{% include avc.html %}, time is life, this is also true for cancer, only the scale is different. Current legislation requires that a patient with suspected cancer begin treatment within 60 days at most. This means all diagnostic steps must be completed within this period. *When it comes to cancer, no one should waste time.*

### Its treatment is complicated

True, cancer treatment, despite medical advances, still often involves major surgeries, sometimes mutilating, and treatments with frequent side effects, such as radiotherapy{% include radioterapia.html %} and chemotherapy{% include chemo-en.html %}. Some recently introduced treatments, such as targeted therapies{% include alvo.html %} or immunotherapy{% include immuno-en.html %}, promise an era of treatments with fewer complications for patients, but these are still in their infancy, very expensive, and their effectiveness is still limited in most cases. *Therefore, it is important to inform patients that the chance of cure is high for most cases.*

### Combating cancer: commitment from the whole society

Responsibility does not lie only with the public authorities or medicine. Cancer is a preventable disease in many cases. Not smoking (neither tobacco nor other herbs), consuming alcohol in moderation, and taking care of one's health (avoiding overweight, eating a balanced diet, exercising, avoiding excessive sun exposure){% include prevention-en.html %} are the main individual actions that can reduce cancer incidence. *These measures are inexpensive, accessible to all, and prevent most cancer cases.*

## Reminders when approaching the patient

- You have a human being in front of you, someone who loves and is loved by others. Do not forget this.
- A suspicion is not a certainty. Leave the definitive diagnosis to the specialist, even if you think "it can't be anything else."
- Always respect the beliefs and characteristics of the person in front of you, *especially if they are different from yours.* If you believe in a different god, have a different race, political opinion, or sexual orientation, or whatever the difference, respect the human being you are talking to and forget the differences. Since the dawn of medicine, doctors have been instructed to act this way. Tolerance has been part of medicine since its birth—do not break this millennial tradition.
- Be concise but polite. The best strategy is always polite sincerity.
- Accept a negative reception. Your patient and their family are not ascetic monks, and even if they are, they are human above all. They have the right to be emotional. It is part of the medical profession to deal with this.
- Share the burden with your fellow health professionals. When you are part of a team, involve the whole team in supporting patients and families.
- Be optimistic, believe!

Beyond technical knowledge, in these moments our humanity matters most. Remember, you are a doctor, representing a very long tradition of balance, tolerance, and perseverance. Be the difference in the world!
