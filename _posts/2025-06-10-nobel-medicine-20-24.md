## Laureates and Themes

### 2020: Discovery of Hepatitis C Virus

- **Laureates:** Harvey J. Alter (USA), Michael Houghton (UK/Canada), Charles M. Rice (USA)
- **Theme:** Identification of the hepatitis C virus, enabling blood tests and curative therapies for a major cause of chronic hepatitis and liver cancer.

Before these discoveries, millions were infected through contaminated blood transfusions, with no precise diagnosis. The laureates' work enabled highly sensitive blood tests, eliminating transfusion-related transmission and leading to antivirals that now cure hepatitis C in over 95% of cases. The global impact is profound, with the World Health Organization targeting hepatitis C elimination as a public health threat.

### 2021: Receptors for Temperature and Touch

- **Laureates:** David Julius (USA), Ardem Patapoutian (Lebanon/USA)
- **Theme:** Discovery of how our bodies sense temperature and mechanical stimuli, through TRP and Piezo receptors.

Julius used capsaicin (the spicy compound in chili peppers) to identify the TRPV1 receptor, responsible for heat sensation. Patapoutian discovered Piezo1 and Piezo2 receptors, essential for touch and pressure. These findings opened new fields in sensory neuroscience, directly impacting the development of painkillers and treatments for chronic pain, and explaining rare genetic diseases related to proprioception. Julius and Patapoutian also collaborated and co-published, highlighting the interconnectedness of the scientific community.

### 2022: Genomes of Extinct Hominins and Human Evolution

- **Laureate:** Svante Pääbo (Sweden/Germany)
- **Theme:** Sequencing the Neanderthal genome and discovering Denisovans, revealing interbreeding with Homo sapiens and transforming our understanding of human evolution.

Pääbo founded paleogenomics, overcoming technical challenges to extract and sequence ancient DNA. His team showed that modern humans inherited genes from Neanderthals and Denisovans, influencing immunity, metabolism, and even responses to diseases like COVID-19. For example, Neanderthal gene variants affect blood clotting (*F5*), pain sensitivity (*SCN9A*), and antiviral immunity (OAS gene cluster), while a Denisovan gene (*EPAS1*) increases altitude tolerance in Himalayan populations. Pääbo's work inspired multidisciplinary collaborations, and his son, Hugo Zeberg, also works in the field, showing family continuity in research.

### 2023: mRNA Vaccine Technology

- **Laureates:** Katalin Karikó (Hungary/USA), Drew Weissman (USA)
- **Theme:** Discoveries enabling the development of mRNA vaccines, crucial in the fight against COVID-19 and opening new avenues for vaccines and therapies.

Karikó and Weissman faced years of skepticism and lack of funding, but their persistence led to the modification of mRNA to avoid inflammatory responses, making clinical use possible. The technology was rapidly applied to COVID-19 vaccines, setting a record for speed and saving millions of lives. Today, mRNA platforms are being tested for cancer, HIV, and autoimmune diseases. Karikó and Weissman collaborated directly, and their stories inspire scientists about the importance of resilience and international collaboration.

### 2024: Discovery of microRNA and Gene Regulation

- **Laureates:** Victor Ambros (USA), Gary Ruvkun (USA)
- **Theme:** Discovery of microRNAs, small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, with profound implications for development, disease, and therapeutics.

Ambros and Ruvkun, who worked in parallel and also collaborated, showed that small non-coding RNAs control gene expression in animals and humans. The microRNA field exploded, revealing roles in cancer, heart disease, neurodegeneration, and immunity. The first RNA interference therapy approved for clinical use (patisiran, for hereditary amyloidosis) is a direct result of these discoveries. RNA-based therapies are now in clinical trials, and the discovery changed our view of so-called "junk DNA." Both laureates have collaborated with other Nobel winners, such as Robert Horvitz.

## Implications for the Present and Future

The awarded technologies and discoveries already have a profound impact today:

- **Hepatitis C:** The disease is close to eradication in several countries thanks to tests and treatments derived from the 2020 discoveries.

- **mRNA Vaccines:** The mRNA platform is being adapted for vaccines against cancer, HIV, influenza, and autoimmune diseases, with clinical trials underway. The record speed of COVID-19 vaccine development demonstrated the potential of this technology.
- [Nature - mRNA vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02483-w)
- **microRNA and RNAi:** The first RNA interference therapy approved for clinical use was patisiran (Onpattro), for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, in 2018. Since then, six RNAi therapies have been FDA-approved, expanding treatment options for genetic and chronic diseases and potentially revolutionizing personalized medicine.

- [Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - RNAi](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-024-00912-9)
- **Evolutionary Genetics:** Genes inherited from Neanderthals, such as *F5* (clotting), *SCN9A* (pain sensitivity), and variants in the *OAS* cluster (antiviral immunity), affect current human traits. A Denisovan gene, *EPAS1*, increases altitude tolerance in Tibetans. These findings help explain disease susceptibility and human adaptations.

In the future, these discoveries are expected to continue transforming medicine, making diagnostics more precise, treatments more personalized, and deepening our understanding of life's fundamental mechanisms. International exchange, multidisciplinary collaboration, and the value of basic science have proven essential for advances that benefit all humanity.

## Conclusion

The last five years of Nobel Prizes in Medicine reflect a golden era for molecular biology and genetics, with discoveries that have immediate impact on human health and deepen our understanding of life itself. Scientific research is fundamental to human well-being and societal progress. However, the rise of scientific denialism and misinformation is concerning, as it threatens historic achievements and hinders access to treatments and vaccines. It is therefore essential to value and disseminate quality, evidence-based information, so that the benefits of science reach everyone and society can make informed decisions about health and public policy.
