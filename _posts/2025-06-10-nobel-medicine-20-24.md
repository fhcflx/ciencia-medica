| 2021 | Receptors for temperature and touch | David Julius, Ardem Patapoutian | USA, Lebanon/USA |
| 2022 | Genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution | Svante Pääbo | Sweden, Germany |
| 2023 | mRNA vaccine technology | Katalin Karikó, Drew Weissman | Hungary/USA, USA |
| 2024 | Discovery of microRNA and gene regulation | Victor Ambros, Gary Ruvkun | USA |

## Laureates and Themes

### 2020: Discovery of Hepatitis C Virus
- **Laureates:** Harvey J. Alter (USA), Michael Houghton (UK/Canada), Charles M. Rice (USA)
- **Theme:** Identification of the hepatitis C virus, enabling blood tests and curative therapies for a major cause of chronic hepatitis and liver cancer.

## What Unites the Themes and Laureates?

- **Molecular and Genetic Focus:** All prizes highlight advances in molecular biology, genetics, and the mechanisms underlying health and disease.
- **Translational Impact:** Each discovery has led to new diagnostics, therapies, or fundamental shifts in biomedical science.
- **International Collaboration:** Many laureates have worked across countries and institutions, reflecting the global nature of modern science.
- **Diversity of Backgrounds:** Laureates include immigrants and those with multicultural backgrounds (e.g., Karikó from Hungary, Patapoutian from Lebanon).
- **Active Scientists:** As of June 2025, all laureates are alive and most remain active in research or academia, except Michael Houghton, who retired but is still alive.

## Controversies and Curiosities

- **2020:** Some debate over the exclusion of other contributors to hepatitis C research, but the main discoverers were recognized.
- **2021:** No major controversies; the discoveries were widely accepted and celebrated.
- **2022:** Some discussion about the focus on ancient DNA, but Pääbo's pioneering work was universally acknowledged.
- **2023:** The rapid development and deployment of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked public debate, but the scientific achievement was clear. Karikó's long struggle for recognition before the Nobel was widely discussed.
- **2024:** The microRNA field is vast, and some researchers contributed to its development, but Ambros and Ruvkun's foundational discoveries were decisive.

## Conclusion

The last five years of Nobel Prizes in Medicine reflect a golden era for molecular biology and genetics, with discoveries that have immediate impact on human health and deepen our understanding of life itself. The laureates' stories are marked by perseverance, international collaboration, and a passion for discovery that continues to inspire the scientific community worldwide.
