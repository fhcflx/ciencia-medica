<b>SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL—</b>Brazil has announced that Marco Antônio Raupp, currently
president of the Brazilian Space Agency, will become the new minister of science,
technology and innovation on 24 January. Unlike the man he will replace,
Aloizio Mercadante, a leading figure in the Worker's Party with little background
in science, Raupp, 73, has more than 40 years of experience in the field. His
appointment has pleased the scientific community, which never warmed to his
predecessor.<br />
<!--more-->

A native of the relatively developed south of the country, Raupp graduated in physics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul  and got his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago. He has taught at universities in Brazil's three most important cities, São  Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,and Brasília, and has worked on a number of important scientific and research institutions.<br /><br />Raupp said he was honored by the president's decision and called it "a crucial moment" in the ministry's development. "I am totally  aware of the unprecedented demands being made on science, technology and innovation to contribute as an essential part of Brazil's social and  economic development," he said in a statement.<br /><br />Raupp's appointment marks a cascade of cabinet changes. Mercadante is leaving the science ministry to take charge of the  education ministry and a much larger budget. The departing education minister, Fernando Haddad, is stepping down to run for mayor of São Paulo in an October election.<br /><br /><i><span class="byline">by Andrew Downie </span>on <abbr class="published" title="19 January 2012">19 January 2012</abbr></i><br /><br /><abbr class="published" title="19 January 2012">posted on ScienceInsider blog&nbsp;</abbr><br /><abbr class="published" title="19 January 2012">Link: </abbr><a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/01/for-its-new-science-minister-brazil.html?ref=em&amp;elq=d1a660422f4848d4a77c708c00983f03#.Tx8so0vt1iQ.blogger">For Its New Science Minister Brazil Picks ...
