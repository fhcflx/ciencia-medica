<span class="sidenote">DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid): a complex organic molecule, DNA is a polymerâ€”a chain made up of simpler molecules. It is composed of four types of molecules: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, which are nucleotides, the monomers (individual parts) that make up the DNA polymer. Each DNA molecule consists of two long strands of nucleotides that coil into a double helix. The order of nucleotides along the DNA strand is not random; it forms a code, called the genetic code, which stores the information needed to produce all the proteins in a cell. In fact, the DNA in each cell contains the information necessary to reproduce the entire organism.</span>
