<br /><div class="content-main">   Massage's healing touch may have more to do with DNA than with good  hands. A new study has revealed for the first time how kneading eases  sore muscles—by turning off genes associated with inflammation and  turning on genes that help muscles heal. The discovery contradicts  popular claims that massage squeezes lactic acid or waste products out  of tired muscles and could bring new medical credibility to the  practice.<br />  Despite massage's widespread popularity, researchers know  surprisingly little about its effects on muscles. The scant evidence makes many physicians  unsure, if not outright skeptical, of the method. <br />  Mark Tarnopolsky, a neurometabolic researcher at McMaster University  in Hamilton, Canada, recruited 11 young healthy men for his research. The subjects underwent a workout session and a  massage therapist massaged one of their legs. Tissue samples from the volunteers' quadriceps muscles were taken—once before  the workout, once 10 minutes after the massage, and once 3 hours after  the workout—and compared the genetic profiles of each sample.<br />  The researchers detected more indicators of cell repair and  inflammation in the post-workout samples than in the pre-workout  samples. Exercise  activates genes associated with repair and inflammation. However, there were clear differences between the massaged legs and the  unmassaged ones after exercise. The massaged legs had more genes associated with cellular energy and less genes associated with inflammation. <br />  The results, published in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>, suggest that <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/119/119ra13.abstract">massage suppresses the inflammation that follows exercise while promoting faster healing</a>. </div><br />Read the full story: <a href="http://bit.ly/xqmGRq">http://bit.ly/xqmGRq</a><br /><a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/02/massages-mystery-mechanism-unmas.html?ref=em">Massage's Mystery Mechanism Unmasked - ScienceNOW</a><br /><br />Read the article: <a href="http://bit.ly/y9Bzzb">http://bit.ly/y9Bzzb</a>
