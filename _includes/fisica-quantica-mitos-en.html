<strong>Quantum physics and myths:</strong> Quantum physics describes the behavior of the microscopic world, from subatomic particles to simple objects a few micrometers in size. Although increasingly larger objects have been placed under laboratory conditions described by quantum physics, the larger the object, the more difficult this becomes. Macroscopic objects, at our everyday scale, are not observed to exhibit quantum behavior. Therefore, quantum equations and concepts do not directly apply to the macroscopic world. For example, it makes no sense to claim that two people could experience quantum entanglement, or that a person could occupy two quantum states simultaneously. This means that the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment (Austria, 1887) was always just that: a speculation with no connection to reality. Schrödinger devised this thought experiment to highlight contradictions in quantum physics, which he believed to be incomplete. Moreover, he did not like cats. Quantum physics shows that elementary particles cannot have arbitrary energy values. They occupy specific energy levels and can "jump" from one value to another, higher or lower, directly, without occupying intermediate states. These energy levels are called <i>quanta</i>, hence the term <i>quantum</i>. The use of these terms outside the scientific context, as in "quantum medicine," constitutes pseudoscience. It can be argued that medicine uses some techniques whose mechanisms are based on quantum physics, such as positron emission tomography (PET). However, this does not justify the term "quantum medicine," because although PET relies on quantum phenomena to function, the patients, professionals, and the exam results themselves are macroscopic and, therefore, do not exhibit quantum behavior. Richard Feynman (USA, 1918), physicist and science communicator, suggested in a 1966 lecture a method to determine whether a claim is scientific or pseudoscientific. He advised asking the proponent to explain it in lay terms, as simply as possible. In this way, it would become clear whether the logic was truly coherent or just a collection of technical-sounding words without real meaning. Unfortunately, in the last six decades, charlatans have become increasingly sophisticated in deceiving people, and this "Feynman test" is not always easy to apply.<br>
