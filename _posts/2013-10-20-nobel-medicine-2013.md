The 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared by scientists James E. Rothman (Yale University), Randy W. Schekman (University of California, Berkeley), and Thomas C. Südhof (Stanford University) for their discoveries on how cells transport molecules internally.

The transport of molecules within cells is vital for functions as diverse as the release of chemical signals by neurons, hormone production, and immune system function. However, before the laureates' work, little was known about how this process occurred.

Molecules produced by cells are packaged as vesicles—small "bubbles" filled with substances. These packages are then transported in a system highly regulated by genes (discovered by Dr. Rothman). Upon arrival at their destination, the packages must "dock" at a "dock" to unload. This complex system was explained by Dr. Schekman. Finally, the "cargo" must be received at the destination and "unpacked" for use, a process elucidated by Dr. Südhof.

Together, they created a new field in biology and explained one of the most fundamental cellular mechanisms. Experts note that this was only possible because the United States had a liberal policy of funding basic research. According to Dr. Rothman, "at that time, the only limit was your ideas." Recent cuts to the U.S. health research budget, especially for basic research, are seen as a threat to future Nobel candidates from that country. "How many will get funding? How many will move abroad?" commented Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.

Are we witnessing the beginning of the end of the U.S. as a scientific powerhouse? The next Nobel Prizes will certainly tell.
