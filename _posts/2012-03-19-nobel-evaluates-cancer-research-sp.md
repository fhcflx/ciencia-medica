In a landmark step for Brazilian science, A.C. Camargo Hospital in São Paulo—responsible for a significant share of the nation's oncology research—invited a panel of internationally acclaimed scientists to conduct an independent peer review of its research and training programs. This initiative, unprecedented in Brazil, signals a commitment to global standards and continuous improvement in cancer research.

The board, conceived by the late oncologist Ricardo Brentani, includes Nobel laureate Harald zur Hausen (Physiology or Medicine, 2008), Curtis Harris (U.S. National Cancer Institute), and other leaders in cancer biology and immunology. Over several days, these experts evaluated the hospital’s research output, infrastructure, and educational environment, aiming to provide constructive feedback and recommendations for future development.

Such international peer review is a hallmark of scientific excellence, fostering transparency and driving innovation. According to the board, A.C. Camargo’s research—particularly in genomics and hereditary cancer—already meets high international standards, with strong potential for further impact as young investigators advance their careers. The hospital’s focus on genetic markers and early counseling for familial cancers exemplifies its forward-looking approach.

The board’s findings will be compiled in a detailed report, and a follow-up visit is planned to assess the implementation of suggested improvements. This process not only benchmarks Brazilian oncology against the world’s best but also encourages a culture of critical self-assessment and scientific ambition.

As emphasized by immunologist António Coutinho, international scrutiny is essential for scientific progress: “It is time for Brazil to invest in science and technology and find better ways to do things. Nothing is invented without deep knowledge. We need to export brains, not just commodities.”
