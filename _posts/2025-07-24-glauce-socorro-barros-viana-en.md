## Education and Career

Glauce Viana was born in Pernambuco (Serra Talhada) in 1941, but most of her life and career took place in Ceará. She graduated in Pharmacy from the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) in 1961, completed her master's degree in Pharmacology{% include farmacologia-en.html %} at the University of California, San Francisco (USA), between 1970 and 1972, and obtained her PhD in Pharmacology from the same institution in 1974. Between 1982 and 1984, she did her postdoctoral studies at the University of Maryland, consolidating her academic training in one of the most innovative areas of contemporary science.

Since 1963, she has worked as a professor at UFC, being an emeritus professor since 1999. She is the first woman at UFC to be a senior researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ([CNPq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_for_Scientific_and_Technological_Development)).She was responsible for creating and coordinating the Laboratory of Neuropsychopharmacology (LNF-UFC), one of the main neuroscience research centers{% include neuroscience-en.html %} in the Northeast of Brazil and the whole country. The laboratory stands out for studies on neurobiological mechanisms of diseases such as epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and pain, as well as research on neuroprotection and neuroplasticity.

## Scientific Contributions

Throughout her career, Glauce Viana has published dozens of scientific articles in national and international journals, supervised many dozens of master's and doctoral students, and participated in innovative research projects. Her work is recognized for investigations into the neurobiological activity of natural and other substances, as well as the role of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurotrophic factors in physiological and pathological processes of the nervous system. She also played a fundamental role in research on natural substances and Brazilian medicinal plants, and we will discuss this further in a later post.

In addition to research, she is known for her commitment to training young scientists, having mentored and inspired generations of researchers in Ceará and Brazil. Her work has contributed to strengthening neuroscience in the Northeast and to the internationalization of Brazilian research.

Internationally, Dr. Glauce Viana has more than 3,000 academic citations and dozens of articles published in high-impact scientific journals, according to Google Scholar ([profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3nGfmtUAAAAJ&hl=en)). Her research covers topics such as neuroprotection, pharmacology of neurodegenerative diseases (including Parkinson's), the gut-brain-microbiome axis{% include microbiome-en.html %}, seizures, effects of natural and synthetic compounds on the nervous system, and pharmacovigilance. Recent works include studies on the role of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease ([Ageing Research Reviews, 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455790/)), neuroprotective effects of natural substances, and investigations into the use of cannabis and vitamin D3 in neurodegenerative diseases. Her scientific output is internationally recognized, contributing to advances in translational and clinical neuroscience.

Among Dr. Glauce Viana's most impactful international works are:

**Synergistic effect of the flavonoid catechin, quercetin, or epigallocatechin gallate with fluconazole induces apoptosis in Candida tropicalis resistant to fluconazole** (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 2014): study that showed in vitro synergy of several flavonoids in the antifungal activity of fluconazole (144 citations to date).

I am proud to have been co-supervised by Dr. Glauce Viana during my master's degree, conducting part of the experiments in her laboratory. There, I learned the technique of stereotaxy{% include stereotaxy-en.html %} in experimental animals with Dr. Geanne Matos Cunha, a fundamental experience for my scientific training. The resulting work was published in Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria ([article](https://www.scielo.br/j/anp/a/htnPkB8snm5JMMhRNSGkvrd/?lang=en)), and the dissertation is available at the [UFC Repository](https://repositorio.ufc.br/handle/riufc/2360). I also had the honor of collaborating with Dr. Glauce Viana on several works, including one of those cited above.

## Recognition and Honors

Glauce Viana has received several honors throughout her career, including academic awards and public recognition. In 2002, she received the Order of Scientific Merit from the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil. In 2019, she was the first person to receive the Professor Francisco José de Abreu Matos Scientific Merit Medal from the Ceará Academy of Sciences. This was the first time the medal was awarded in the history of the Academy. In 2023, she was honored by the Legislative Assembly of Ceará for her contribution to science and education, highlighting the role of women in scientific research. She is also a member of the Ceará Academy of Sciences (ACECI) and the Ceará Academy of Pharmacy.

## Social Impact and Education

In addition to her scientific work, Glauce Viana is engaged in science communication{% include divulgacao-cientifica-en.html %} and education projects, promoting access to knowledge and encouraging women's participation in science. Her work inspires young students and researchers, reinforcing the importance of diversity and inclusion in the academic environment.
