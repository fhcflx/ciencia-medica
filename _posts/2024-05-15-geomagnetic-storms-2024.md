In May 2024, Earth was struck by a series of intense geomagnetic storms {% include geomag-storm-en.html %} triggered by powerful coronal mass ejections (CMEs) {% include geomag-cme-en.html %} from the Sun. These storms produced auroras {% include geomag-aurora-en.html %} visible at exceptionally low latitudes, including parts of the United States, Brazil, Europe, and even [North Africa][arabiaweather].   <!--more-->
The phenomenon was widely documented by observers and scientists, marking one of the most significant space weather events of the 21st century.

## What are geomagnetic storms?

Geomagnetic storms are disturbances in Earth's magnetic field caused by interactions with highly energetic solar particles, especially during CMEs. They can disrupt communications, power grids, satellites, and even cause auroras at unusual latitudes.

## Comparison with historic events

The May 2024 storms were classified as G5 (extreme) by NOAA SWPC, with Kp {% include geomag-kp-en.html %} indices reaching 9. For comparison:

**Carrington Event (1859):** The largest geomagnetic storm ever recorded, causing telegraph failures and auroras as far south as the Caribbean.

**Quebec Storm (1989):** Caused a blackout in Canada and auroras at mid-latitudes.

**May 2024 Storms:** Auroras seen as far south as southern Brazil and Texas, with reports of power grid and navigation disruptions.

| Event                | Year | Max Kp | Main Impact                                 |
|----------------------|------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Carrington           | 1859 | 9+     | Telegraph failures, tropical auroras         |
| New York Railroad    | 1921 | 9      | Railroad fires, telegraph/telephone outages  |
| Quebec               | 1989 | 9      | Blackout, mid-latitude auroras               |
| Halloween Storms     | 2003 | 9      | Satellite, GPS, aviation disruptions         |
| May 2024             | 2024 | 9      | Low-latitude auroras, power disruptions      |
| March Storm          | 1989 | 9      | Power grid failures, auroras                 |
| May Storm            | 1921 | 9      | Telegraph/telephone outages, fires           |
| August Storm         | 1972 | 8-9    | Satellite, communication disruptions         |
| July Storm           | 1958 | 9      | Auroras at low latitudes                     |
| September Storm      | 1941 | 9      | Telegraph/telephone outages, auroras         |

## Historical Section: The Carrington and Quebec Events

### The Carrington Event (1859)

The Carrington Event is considered the most powerful geomagnetic storm ever recorded. On September 1, 1859, British astronomer Richard Carrington observed and drew a massive group of sunspots, followed by a sudden bright flash—now known as a solar flare {% include geomag-flare-en.html %}. This was the first time a solar flare was directly linked to geomagnetic disturbances on Earth.

Within 17 hours, a coronal mass ejection (CME) reached Earth, causing auroras visible as far south as the Caribbean and northern South America. Telegraph systems across Europe and North America failed, with some operators receiving electric shocks and telegraph paper catching fire. Some systems continued to operate even when disconnected from their power supplies, powered by geomagnetically induced currents.

**About Richard Carrington:**
Richard Christopher Carrington (1826–1875) was a pioneering English astronomer who made significant contributions to solar physics. His observations in 1859 provided the first evidence of a direct connection between solar activity and geomagnetic storms on Earth.

### The Quebec Storm (March 1989)

The Quebec geomagnetic storm occurred on March 13, 1989, and is one of the most significant space weather events of the modern era. Triggered by a powerful CME, the storm caused a nine-hour blackout in the Canadian province of Quebec, leaving six million people without electricity. The event also disrupted satellites, radio communications, and caused auroras as far south as Texas and Florida.

**Repercussions:**

- Power grid transformers were damaged in Canada and the US.
- Satellite operations were disrupted, and some satellites tumbled out of control.
- Shortwave radio and navigation systems experienced outages.
- The event led to major investments in space weather monitoring and grid protection.

**Dates involved:**

- March 9, 1989: Solar flare and CME observed.
- March 13, 1989: Geomagnetic storm and blackout in Quebec.

### What if a Carrington-level event happened today?

A storm of Carrington magnitude could cause widespread blackouts, damage to transformers, satellite failures, GPS and communication disruptions, and economic losses in the trillions of dollars. Modern society is far more dependent on electricity and technology than in 1859, making us more vulnerable to such events.

**How likely is another Carrington event?**
Studies estimate that Carrington-class storms have a probability of about 1–2% per decade (roughly once every 50–100 years). While rare, the risk is significant enough that governments and utilities are investing in monitoring and mitigation strategies.

## Space Weather Monitoring and Its Importance

Space weather monitoring is crucial for protecting modern technological infrastructure from the effects of geomagnetic storms. Several national and international agencies operate space weather monitoring and alert systems:

**NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC, USA):** The leading U.S. agency for space weather forecasting, monitoring, and alerts. Provides real-time data, warnings, and educational resources.

**ESA Space Weather Office (Europe):** The European Space Agency coordinates space weather monitoring and research across Europe.

**UK Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (UK):** Provides forecasts and alerts for the UK and collaborates internationally.

**Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA):** Monitors solar and geomagnetic activity in East Asia.

**Other agencies:** Canada, Russia, China, and Australia also maintain space weather programs.

These agencies share data and collaborate through the International Space Environment Service (ISES), a global network for space weather information exchange.

### Space Weather Alert Programs

Most agencies operate public alert systems that notify utilities, satellite operators, airlines, and the public about ongoing or expected space weather events. Alerts are issued using standardized scales:

**Kp Index:** A global geomagnetic activity index ranging from 0 (very quiet) to 9 (extremely disturbed). Kp values of 5 or higher indicate geomagnetic storm conditions.

**G Scale (NOAA):** The NOAA SWPC uses the G scale to classify geomagnetic storms:

| G Level | Description | Kp Index | Typical Effects |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| G1      | Minor       | 5        | Weak power grid fluctuations, minor satellite impact, auroras at high latitudes |
| G2      | Moderate    | 6        | Possible voltage alarms, transformer damage at high latitudes, auroras at mid-latitudes |
| G3      | Strong      | 7        | Voltage corrections required, false alarms on some protection devices, auroras as far south as Illinois/Oregon (US) |
| G4      | Severe      | 8        | Widespread voltage control problems, possible transformer damage, auroras as far south as Alabama (US) |
| G5      | Extreme     | 9        | Widespread power system problems, grid collapse possible, auroras seen in Texas/Florida (US) |

These scales help communicate the severity and potential impacts of geomagnetic storms to decision-makers and the public.
