<span class="sidenote">Genetic material is what exists inside a cell and carries the information about the characteristics of a living being. The inheritance of traits from parents to offspring has been known since ancient times, but only in the 1850s-60s did the Czech scientist Gregor Mendel study inheritance patterns in detail and suggest that hypothetical elements (later called "genes" by Johannsen in 1905) were responsible for heredity. The nature of these genes remained unclear until it was demonstrated in the 1940s-50s that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the molecule responsible for genetic inheritance.</span>
