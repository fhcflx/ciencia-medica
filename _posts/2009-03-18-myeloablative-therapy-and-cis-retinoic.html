The results of study CCG-3891 were published in March 2009 on Journal of Clinical Oncology. The multicentric study has shown that high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy followed by stem-cell rescue is better than conventional chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Moreover, addition of cis-retinoic acid treatment after chemotherapy could boost survival in both groups. Standard therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma patients should be therefore myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue followed by cis-retinoic acid treatment.<br />Read the article <a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/27/7/1007.full.pdf+html">here</a>.
