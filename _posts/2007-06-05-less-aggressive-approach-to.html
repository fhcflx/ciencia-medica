Chemotherapy consisted of 2 to 3 drug combinations of carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.<br /><br />"The bottom line is that with significantly less intense chemotherapy, we achieved 3-year overall survival of 96%," Dr. David L. Baker told the 43rd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
