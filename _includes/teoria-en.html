<strong>Scientific theories:</strong> Explanatory models based on evidence and observation. Always provisional, they may be revised or replaced in light of new data. This definition traces back to Aristotle (Stagira, Greece, 4th century BCE), who defined <em>theoretical knowledge</em> as the product of logical reasoning, not directly related to the sensible world (as in metaphysics). This was adapted by early modern natural philosophers such as Galileo Galilei (Pisa, 1564) and Isaac Newton (England, 1643), who emphasized observation and experimentation in theory formulation, in contrast to Aristotle. The term "scientist" was coined in the 19th century by philosopher William Whewell (England, 1794), a proponent of building theories through induction from observation. This definition of <em>theory</em> was used by 19th-century positivism and persisted through the post-positivism of Karl Popper (Vienna, 1902), who argued that scientific theories are conjectures to be tested and falsified, not merely confirmed. In the 1960s, philosopher Thomas Kuhn (USA, 1922) broadened the concept to include scientific revolutions and introduced the idea of paradigms dominating a scientific field, with transitions between them driving scientific progress.<br>
