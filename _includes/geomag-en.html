<strong>Geomagnetic field:</strong> is Earth's magnetic field, generated by the movement of the planet's liquid outer core, mainly composed of iron and nickel. This magnetic field extends from Earth's interior into space, forming a region called the magnetosphere, which protects the planet from charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic radiation. The geomagnetic field is crucial for navigation, as it guides compasses and influences communication systems and satellites. It also plays an important role in the formation of auroras when solar particles interact with Earth's atmosphere. Its average value at the surface is 25 to 65 &micro;T (microtesla) and varies over time due to changes in Earth's core and solar activity, being monitored by several scientific agencies worldwide.
