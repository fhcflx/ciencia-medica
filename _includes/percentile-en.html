<span class="sidenote"><strong>Percentile</strong> (<em>statistics</em>) in this context is a statistical measure that indicates the relative position of a value within an ordered data set. The percentile is the value below which a certain percentage of the data falls. For example, the 50th percentile (or median) is the value below which 50% of the data are located. If a student is in the 90th percentile on a test, it means they scored better than 90% of the other students who took the same test. The 10th percentile, on the other hand, indicates that 10% of the data are below that value. Percentiles are often used to understand the distribution of data and to identify outliers or extreme values. They are useful in various fields, such as education, health, and finance, to compare performance or characteristics between different groups or populations.
