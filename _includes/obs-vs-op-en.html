<strong>Observation vs. Opinion:</strong> Science is grounded in objective observation of the world, while opinions are subjective judgments. The scientific method aims to minimize the influence of personal bias in interpreting facts. In <em>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</em>, Karl Popper addressed this issue in scientific empiricism. Thinkers such as Rudolf Carnap (Germany, 1891) and Otto Neurath (Austria, 1882), both key figures in <em>logical positivism</em>—a school that still influences scientific research concepts, though long debated—distinguished between formal and material (perceptual) statements. Perceptual statements attest to sensory experience, while formal statements are ideas derived from experience, structured by logic. In <em>inductivism</em>, formal statements are <em>induced</em> from perceptual ones. Note that statements only relate to other statements, not directly to facts <em>a priori</em>, a distinction Popper considered crucial. He questioned how perceptual statements could be verified. If, as Carnap proposed, these were always accepted as true, what would prevent any group united by illogical beliefs (but with a consistent narrative and mutual "testimonies") from claiming to practice a new "empirical science"? Popper had in mind psychoanalysis and socialism when proposing a process for verifying scientific knowledge, but sought to generalize his criterion to address what he saw as a vulnerability in the scientific method. His approach assumes <em>it is not possible to prove a scientific idea or theory, but it is possible to refute it</em>. Mathematically, one cannot determine the value of an observable with absolute precision, only with an approximation approaching a limit (central limit theorem); in hypothesis testing, the alternative hypothesis is not proven, but the null hypothesis can be refuted. Popper's criterion is thus falsifiability. Only if observations can be repeatedly tested and potentially refuted (falsified), even if not actually falsified, can an observation, idea, or theory be considered scientific. I do not elaborate this in the post, but clarify the difference between empirical inductivism (knowledge from repeated, careful observation) and reasoning based solely on beliefs and prior assumptions (opinion). Falsificationism has become fundamental to modern scientific methodology.<br>
