_Nobel Prize medal (all rights reserved to the Nobel Foundation)_

In September and October 2024, some thousands of academics and public figures around the world received invitation letters to nominate candidates for the 2025 Nobel Prize. Nominations were accepted until the end of January this year. From that point, members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy and the Swedish Parliament began a process that lasted almost the whole year and will conclude with the selection of the 2025 Nobel laureates in the week starting 6 October, Monday. During this period they met many times, wrote detailed reports, consulted experts worldwide and debated among themselves. From 6 October they will present their proposals to the members of the Academies, the Assemblies and the Parliament, who will vote on the winners. Immediately afterward, up to three people will receive the famous phone calls informing them of the prize.

The rules of the Nobel Foundation do not allow disclosure of the nominators, the nominees or documents from the selection process for 50 years. The Norwegian Nobel Committee reported receiving 338 nominations for this year's Peace Prize, including 197 individuals and 89 organizations. The committees of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which choose the winners of the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry and Economic Sciences, do not disclose the number of nominees. The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, responsible for selecting the laureates in Physiology or Medicine, also does not disclose numbers, nor does the Swedish Academy, which chooses the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Nevertheless, we do not have to be completely in the dark about who the possible laureates might be.

## Academia predictions

Below are the names that have appeared in surveys and specialist articles — with a brief note on the profile and the work that places them among possible laureates.

## Nobel Prize in Chemistry
